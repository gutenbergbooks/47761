<p class="p1">In venturing to place before the public this little
work&mdash;which takes up a line of enquiry never before
attempted,&mdash;I would solicit criticism, not of that slashing
condemnatory kind which destroys a statement without
pointing out its correction;&mdash;that would only break my
head, and make no one the wiser!&mdash;but I hope that
antiquaries who have more knowledge than I, may, when
pointing out errors, also explain what such statements
ought to be, and give exact references in proof.</p>

<p>With the help of such criticism (and the more severe,
the more valuable it will be) I trust that another perfected
issue, by myself, or by some other more qualified writer,
may eventually appear as a handbook&mdash;most useful to
the student, the antiquary, and the traveller.</p>

<p>It is now a subject for much regret to all of us that
the great knowledge of seals (the chief source of evidence
as to ancient shields) acquired by the late Mr. Albert
Way, F.S.A., and by the late Mr. Charles Spencer Perceval,
F.S.A., has passed away with them, never having been
recorded; and it seems very desirable that a classified
body of such knowledge should be drawn up and available&mdash;enabling
us to date with some certainty (within the
limit of a few years) seals pendant to undated charters,
stone carvings on ancient buildings, and illustrations in
MSS., which are now labelled "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of my researches I have noticed a number
of cases where incorrect dates have been <em>supposed</em>,&mdash;and
from some of these deductions have been drawn, which
are consequently all wrong.</p>

<p>In the following treatise each century from the eleventh
to the fifteenth is separately dealt with; after that date
the nomenclature of shields devised by my friend Mr.
J. Paul Rylands, F.S.A., is followed, and the earliest and
latest examples found of each shape adduced,&mdash;thus
showing the range of time when that variety was most
commonly in use. References are given for every
statement.</p>

<p>Mantlings, torces, wreaths, palm branches, and other
adjuncts are discussed under their several headings&mdash;with
descriptions and dates of any varieties found.</p>

<p>In conclusion a concise index is given, which, it is
hoped, sufficiently focuses the whole book for ready
reference.</p>

THE VARIOUS SHAPES FOUND IN
HERALDIC SHIELDS&mdash;PRINCIPALLY
IN ENGLAND, WITH INCIDENTAL
DATINGS.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>

<div class="decoration"> </div>

<p class="p1">It seems necessary, by way of introduction, to
say a few words on the circular convex shields
used from very early times by our Saxon and
Norman ancestors. These were of wood, with a
central boss of bronze, and were sometimes of
very large size; frequently, if we may judge from
contemporaneous illuminations, as much as four
feet in diameter. Across the inside of the boss
a handle was fixed, and the shields, which were
thus held out almost at arm's length, as represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in many ancient MSS., must have been most
cumbersome. It is hard to see how the sword
or lance could have been conveniently used. The
round shape must have interfered greatly with the
view of one's opponent, and a bungler would
inevitably slice pieces from off his own shield
while attacking his enemy. Moreover, such shields
must have been lightly made: we know exactly
how the bosses were fastened with rivets through
the shield, for they are constantly found in Anglo-Saxon
grave mounds, and the wood is thus known
to have been of some thickness. But we can
obtain from contemporary writings many more
particulars.</p>

<p>By the laws of Gula [said to have been established
by Hacon the Good, who died 963] any
possessor of six marks was required to furnish
himself with a <em>red</em> shield, of two boards in thickness,
a spear, and an axe or a sword.</p>

<p>In the history of the same king [<cite>Heimskringla</cite>,
vol. i, p. 155] he is thus described: "he put on
his tunic of mail (brynio), girded round him his
sword called quern-bit [<i>i.e.</i>, millstone-biter], and
set on his head his gilded helmet. He took a
spear in his hand, and hung his shield <em>by his
side</em>."</p>

<p>Again, in the same book [<cite>Heimskringla</cite>, ii, 352],
in the description of the Battle of Sticklastad,
where Olaf King of Norway, called "the Saint,"
was slain 1030, the monarch is said to have worn
a golden helmet, a white shield, a golden hilted
and exceedingly sharp sword, and a tunic of ringed
mail ("hringa brynio").</p>

<p>Again, in the <cite>Edda Gunnar</cite> one of the Reguli of
Germany says, "My helmet and my <em>white</em> shield
come from the Hall of Kiars."</p>

<p>These quotations are hardly sufficient evidence
of it perhaps, but it seems as if in the tenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
century <em>white</em> shields were borne by leaders and
<em>red</em> ones by the common soldiers,&mdash;every one who
possessed six marks.</p>

<p>Supplementing these and completing our description,
Saxon poetry tells us that the wood was
by preference the lime tree. I need not give
quotations; they will be found in the several
works on ancient arms and armour. Beowulf
[line 5215] describes how Wigluf "seized his
shield&mdash;the yellow linden wood." Again, these
lines occur [<cite>Poem of Judith</cite>, Thorpe's <cite>Analecta</cite>,
p. 137]:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"The warriors marched<br />
"The chieftains to the war<br />
"Protected with targets,<br />
"With arched linden shields."<br />
</div>

<p>It seems almost as if linden trees were cultivated
with this view, for the <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite>, under
anno 937, tells us how King Athelstan and his
heroes</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"the board walls clove,</span><br />
"And hewed the war lindens."<br />
</div>

<p>But certainly on one occasion remains of oak
timber were found in connection with the bronze
boss of an Anglo-Saxon shield.</p>

<p>Occasionally rims of metal have been found
with such remains, but such protecting edgings
do not seem to have been the usual custom. The
laws of Gula, quoted above, mention "two boards
in thickness," that is, glued crossways, to prevent
warping or splitting. Such a formation in a
convex shield would show a very great amount
of skill in the working of wood at this early date.
Leather seems to have been sometimes stretched
over the shield; because the laws of Athelstan
forbade the use of sheepskins for the purpose, under
a penalty of 30s.: a very large sum. Had skin
coverings been common, remains of such skins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
would be found still attached inside the bronze
bosses; but only one skin-covered shield has been
found [at Linton Heath, in Cambridgeshire], and
in that the skin covered the boss also, having been
stretched over the whole shield.</p>

<p>Lastly, <em>red</em> seems to have been at least a
favourite colour, for Sœmund's <cite>Edda</cite> mentions a
red shield with a golden border, and Giraldus de
Barri says the Irish "carried red shields, in
imitation of the Danes."</p>

<p>The boss was often carried out into a sharp
spike, and the shield could thus be used for offence
as well as for protection. But perhaps such points
were also found of use in stopping the cut of a
sword, which might otherwise slip down the shield
and find a resting-place in the leg or other exposed
part.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p>We shall
see as we
proceed
that such
circular
shields or
targets constantly
appear
till the
middle of
the seventeenth
century,
borne by foot soldiers,
with pikes, halberds, and
swords, and sometimes as
large as two feet in diameter.
Frequently foot
soldiers are represented
with a small target, ten or
twelve inches in diameter,
wherewith to receive their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
opponent's cut, while the other arm wields a
huge broadsword. Such were in later times called
"targetiers." Their small targets were hooked to
the side when not in use, and one is represented in
1473 which projects to a point (Hewitt, ii, 488),
while others are flat and studded with nails, or
otherwise ornamented, such as appear among the
Scotch and Irish till a much later date. Small
shields of a square form, and ten inches square,
were used by fencers with rapiers in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>Such is a hasty sketch of the circular shields.
They were used by all ranks of the Saxon nations&mdash;among
whom, of course, were those we call
Normans&mdash;to the end of the tenth century.</p>

<p>Fitness for the purposes of defence is the prime
governing law in such matters. We shall see this
leading to many strange alterations of shape in
after centuries, and, at the date at which we have
now arrived, (the first half of the eleventh century,)
a perfect revolution in the appearance of shields
took place within a space of about fifty years.</p>

<p>Meyrick explains how the Normans who were
engaged in the conquest of Apulia, in the south-east
of Italy, about the beginning of the eleventh
century, learned there the advantages of long and
narrow shields, such as were then in use among
the Sicilians, and states that about fifty years
before the battle of Hastings they received from
Melo, the chief of Barri, supplies of such vastly
improved arms. The intimate relations with
Normandy at that time, and under Edward the
Confessor, led to their prompt adoption in England
also; and hence in the Bayeux tapestry kite-shaped
shields No. 3 are universal among horse soldiers,
both Anglo-Saxon and Norman. Some Saxon foot
soldiers bear the old round shields, and one square-shaped
one appears on that roll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a very amusing picture of Harold and
his companions proceeding, in company with
William of Normandy, to the conquest of Britanny.
They came to the little river Coësnon, where, the
tide being out, the river-bed was an expanse of
slippery mud. The prudent ones dismounted and
led their horses across; but one horse is represented
coming down and the rider falling over his head,
while his shield flies through the air attached to
his neck by the guige [Bruce's <cite>Bayeux Tapestry</cite>,
p. 61]. This "guige" was another most valuable
improvement which probably came from Sicily
with the new shape of shields. It was a leather
strap sufficiently long to let it hang from the neck,
and so, when two hands were required to wield a
battle axe or heavy weapon, the shield could be
flung loose and recovered again.
I am aware that
in Cotton MS. Cleopatra,
cviii, written early in the
eleventh century, a group
of Saxon horsemen is
represented on a journey,
and the round shield of
one hangs from his back,
looking like the beehive
which the knight in <cite>Alice
in Wonderland</cite> thought
might some day prove
useful. It has, it will
be seen, an absurdly awkward appearance [Hewitt,
vol. i, p. 77; Cutts, p. 313].</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="250" height="236" alt="knight" />
</div>

<p>The principle, then, of the kite-shaped shields
which we see in the eleventh century was that,
with as much compactness as possible, they should
protect the body with the wider part, while the
extended point was sufficient to defend the leg;
and following so nearly the shape of the body the
knight had his sword-arm free. They seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
have been five feet long or even more, for they
served as a bier whereon to carry away the slain
or wounded.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is amusing to see Goliath
represented with a kite-shaped shield, while the
little David on the top of him tries to wield his
huge sword. This appears in a Latin Bible of 1170.
[Brit. Mus., Add. MS. 14789, fo. 10; engraved,
Hewitt, i, 134.]</p>

<div class="figright">
	<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="276" height="450" alt="men with armour, spears and shields" />
</div>

<p>A remarkable recrudescence of old ideas both in
the shapes and sizes of shields occurs from time
to time as we proceed.
At times they seem to
have been nearly as
much as five feet long&mdash;and
then, as protective
mail became more
perfect, and probably
the varying style of
fighting required it,
they were greatly reduced.
King David
and his followers appear
[Cutts, p. 335],
on their expedition
against Nabal, in full
mail of the end of the
thirteenth century,
with shields scarcely
eighteen inches long&mdash;just
sufficient to prevent
the point of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lance reaching some flat or dangerous or vulnerable
spot from whence it would not readily glide off, or
to receive the blows of an assailant's sword. Nor
can we suppose that one scale of size, or indeed
one exact shape of shield, reigned universal at any
one period; every knight had his own fancies as to
which best suited him; and at length we find many
illuminations of the sixteenth century in which
knights appear jousting and fighting without any
shields at all. They were hung up, to show the
heraldry, on their tents, and the massive body-armour
alone was considered sufficient protection.</p>

<hr class="mini" />

<p>These few explanatory words are necessary to
introduce upon the scene the various shaped shields
occurring during the centuries which follow. While
considering these variations we must bear in mind
that they are strongly marked into two great
divisions, viz., before the sixteenth century, when
shields were in actual use and any alteration in
their outline was considered to be an improvement
to meet some freshly noticed want; this will be
further referred to as instances occur. During
and after the sixteenth century, shapes were selected
in an arbitrary way, as a matter of taste alone;
and hence earlier examples were sometimes exactly
adopted, while at other times details and alterations
were introduced, just to suit the fancy of the
purchaser or artist and the conventional style of
the times.</p>

<p>As references for what has already been said,
I would name the works of Meyrick and Hewitt,
Planché's work on Costume, Strutt's <cite>Horda</cite>, and
a learned paper on shields, by Sir Frederick
Madden, in <cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xxiv. This, although
primarily discussing the chessmen found in the
Island of Lewis, contains the results of wide
researches as to shields in the eleventh and twelfth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
centuries. There is also a valuable and well
illustrated book, <cite>Scenes and Characters of the Middle
Ages</cite>, by A. L. Cutts, published by Messrs. Virtue
and Co., 1872.</p>

<p>The principal authority for the accurate dating
and classifying of shields is the immense number
of mediæval seals attached to deeds and charters,
and with dates exactly known. If it were practicable
to arrange in chronological sequence illustrations
of a sufficient number of these, we should
at once have the classification of dates, styles, and
shapes, which would be so very valuable, and
which it is the attempt of this paper to display.
Hence it is that to the end of the fifteenth century
seals form so large a part of the evidences
submitted. The certainty of such records is
unsurpassed: we have a parchment, itself dated,
or the date of which in very early instances can
be otherwise closely ascertained; and attached to
this we have a seal with the shield; and, to make
it perfectly certain, we have the owner's name
inscribed around it, and so we know he is not
using some one else's seal, found or come down to
him from earlier times. Such instances frequently
occur, and are at once in this way detected. There
are instances where the same seal, acquired in
early life, continued to be used for over fifty years;
but that is the extent to which such valuable
proofs can wander from the actual prevailing type
and date.</p>

<p>Besides seals, the many invaluable illuminations
in the British Museum and Bodleian Libraries,
and in the great Continental Libraries, furnish
numberless pictures of knights and their accoutrements,
contemporaneously executed, and with the
most manifest exactness in every detail. Many of
these have been engraved in our popular literature,
as well as in the learned works named above; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to enable the mind to form correct conclusions
these should be all cut out and arranged in groups
of exact dates, or drawn as they are in a student's
note book.</p>

<p>The earlier monumental effigies afford many
valuable examples of shields, and after they cease
to be represented by the side of the figure, such
often appear among the architectural details,
giving the shape of shield, with an exact date
attached.</p>

<p>Monumental brasses give evidence to a later
date, and the canopy work introduced often carries
ornamental shields.</p>

<p>Architectural stone carvings frequently give data
of great value. I need only refer to those put up
in Westminster Abbey about 1260, which show the
exact shape and proportions of some of the shields
then used, and are represented as hanging by
their "guiges" from stone projections carved into
various devices. But representations in stone and
in stained glass, especially those of later date, seem
to be greatly influenced by their surroundings, and
cannot therefore be implicitly relied on as proofs
of style and date. They are often found not to
correspond exactly with other examples; indeed
it is a curious fact, which all my fellow students
will vouch for, that these two&mdash;stone and glass&mdash;seem
of all materials most liable to err. The
good name of many a respectable family has been
ruined by the bend sinister introduced through
the ignorant determination of some stone-carver;
while in glass, colours are altered, and impaled
shields have been turned round and so reversed;
while, in the particular subject under discussion,
viz., the exact shapes of shields which obtained at
various dates, we find in both stone and glass that
their shapes follow the necessities of the rest of
the design, and are made to fit into them.</p>

<p>Printed books supply many shields from the end
of the fifteenth century, showing the artistic taste
in such matters which prevailed from that date to
the present. Printers' marks begin still earlier,
and are often contained in shields; but these
usually show a spirit of exaggeration, and convey
the impression that such would not be found
elsewhere, and hence they are not of much use to
us in our present purpose of laying down exact
dates.</p>

<p>Grants of arms and book-plates come in to
continue our information, giving shapes and the
decorations surrounding them. Book-plates are
usually efforts of art and taste at the dates when
they were executed, and these two occur just at
the time when other evidences fall short, and so
they are peculiarly valuable.</p>

<p>In the following remarks I shall gladly avail
myself of the new system of nomenclature devised
and introduced by my friend, Mr. J. Paul Rylands,
F.S.A. I welcome it as a most valuable desideratum,
by means of which I hope to make my
subject intelligible. Without such a system a still
greater number of illustrations would have been
required, and I should like to bear my small
testimony to its very great and, I expect, increasing
usefulness. It is not everyone who has the ready
hand to dash off the correct outline when seeking
to communicate the style of a shield, or a book-plate,
and here we have a simple alphabet of
shapes which can be read and understanded of all
men, and which will certainly be found so convenient
that it will come into general use.</p>

<p>Our examples of shields show very few varieties,
nearly all seem to follow the long kite shape or
"Norman pear" Nos. 3 and 4. The great seals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of William I.,
William Rufus, and Henry I. all
show this shield, also that of Ilbert de Laci
[<cite>Archæological
Journal</cite>, vol. iv,
p. 249], while
the Bayeux tapestry,
worked
at the end of
this century, represents
them
exactly. Seeing,
as we do
in the seals of
this date, which
mostly represented
mounted
horsemen, the
inside only, it
may be noticed
that all seem to be strengthened round their edges.
In those of William I. and Ilbert de Laci a metal
rim is shown; in that of William Rufus two of
such strips, while in that of Henry I. rivets appear
to fasten a similar rim on the other side. In the
Bayeux tapestry some round shields with pointed
bosses appear, and one of a square shape rounded
at the corners.</p>

<p>In seals the lettering of the inscriptions is in
plain Roman capitals, while longobardic letters for
G E A and D appear sometimes, but in several
seals preserved from this early date the inscriptions
have unfortunately decayed away.</p>

<p class="unindent">exhibits several varieties of shape, Norman and
the Norman convex at the top (Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4);
and many of these are curved, so as to partially
surround the body. The great seal of Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
represents a pointed boss and a shield almost
pear-shaped. One very curious seal, that of
Richard Basset, about 1145, merits a full description.
He appears bearing a kite-shaped or very
elongated pear-shaped shield (No. 3), about four
feet long, and carried down to a sharp point. The
top is bi-lobed, like a heart, and it is strengthened
all round by a metal rim, while further strength is
imparted by a boss or figure like a simple escarboucle,
carried out to the sides. He wields a very
powerful sword, with an extraordinarily heavy hilt,
and with it he cuts off the large duck-like beak of
a formidable rampant-winged animal like a dragon,
and, apparently, thus frees a human figure held in
its beak. This curious seal is attached to a
charter printed in Blomefield's <cite>History of Norfolk</cite> (see No. 44).
The seal of Gilbert de Gant, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
died 1156, presents a shield more triangular than
No. 2, and in the centre is a sharp pointed boss
[<cite>Top. and Gen.</cite>, i, 317]. The
same boss appears
in the seal of Ralph
son of William, of
Dimsdale-on-Tees,
1174-80 (<cite>Herald and
Genealogist</cite>, i, 227);
also in a good many
contemporaneous
seals, and it was evidently
meant for use
as an offensive weapon.
It is noteworthy
that on the first seal
of Richard I. a spike is
shown on the shield;
his first coronation
was in 1189. On
the second seal there
is none; his second
coronation took place
on 17th April, 1194.
This may show the
date when this fashion
was discontinued. In
the seal of Sewal de
Ethindon, about 1167, the curved shield of Norman
form, No. 2, runs down into a long point,
somewhat twisted round, so as to show down
on the right side of the rider. It does not protect
his leg at all; in fact, the arrangement, to our eyes,
seems awkward and most embarrassing to the
mounted knight (engraved Nicholas Upton, p. 84;
see No. 45). While in that of Sayer de Quinci,
towards the end of this century, a heater-pear shield
No. 6 appears. This is engraved in Spelman's
<cite>Aspilogia</cite>, p. 67.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">The men's seals of this date which present their
shields for our consideration usually show
them
on horseback, fully caparisoned;
and many
interesting details of
spurs, swords, and
arms are represented,
as well as the furniture
for their horses. We
are able here to show
the two seals of Malgerus
le Vavasour,
1140-50, showing
heater-pear, almost
heart-shaped shields.
See <cite>Collect. Topog. et
Genealog.</cite>, vol. vi, p.
127, where the deed to
which these are attached
is supposed to date between 1180-6; but
Malger's son, William Vavasour, was a judge
1166-84 [Itinerary of
Henry II.], and Sir
Robert, the grandson,
paid a heavy fine&mdash;1200
marks and two
palfreys&mdash;in 9 John,
1207-8, that Maud his
daughter [and widow
of Theobald Walter]
might marry Fulke
Fitzwarine: we have
thus no difficulty in
proving that the date
of this seal is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i>
1140 to 1150. We
also give the beautiful
seal of Egidius de Gorram, 1175-80 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>[<cite>Collectanea
Topog. et Genealog.</cite>, vol. v, p. 187.] The unmounted
knight is represented in
scale armour, kneeling,
and holding a sort of
heater-pear shield, No. 6, with a pointed boss.</p>

<p>The fields of seals are
now quite plain, except
sometimes in those
of ladies. In the first
seal of Roheis de Gant,
Countess of Lincoln
before 1156, lilies are
introduced, to fill up
what would otherwise
appear too great a bare
space. This is engraved
in <cite>Topog. and Genealogist</cite>,
vol. i, p. 318.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p>In counterseals of this century heater shields
appear such as are
common during the
next century. A most
curious instance of a
pear-shaped curved
shield, having a bouche
cut into it for the introduction
of the spear, occurs
in the seal of Theodoric
Count of Flanders,
1159, who wears
tegulated armour. It
is engraved in Oliver
Vredius, p. 17 (see No.
46). So far as we know,
this useful bouche, as
a resting place for the
spear, disappeared&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
crop up again, as an improvement and novelty, in
the middle of the fourteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>The marvellous set of chessmen found in the
Isle of Lewis afford us a most interesting series of
shields of this century. They are fully illustrated,
<cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xxiv.
They give us the long
Norman pear or kite-shaped
No. 3, the
Norman convex No.
4, also a flattened
convex with rounded
corners, and these
shields are all long
and narrow, just wide
enough to cover the
body. There are
many instances of exactly
similar shields.
In Harl. MS. 2803, a
Bible, written about
1170, Goliath of Gath
bears a shield exactly
resembling them; and
in the most interesting
monumental effigy of
William, Count of
Flanders, son of Robert,
Duke of Normandy,
who died in
1127, engraved in
Oliver Vredius' <cite>Seals
of the Counts of Flanders,
1639</cite>, p. 14. He
apparently was a very
old man at his death. He bears a shield exactly
like the Lewis chessmen in shape, but the face of
it is filled up with an elaborate escarboucle, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
out and attached to the rim, which wholly surrounds
the shield. Shields with the flattened convex top
and rounded corners, but of much shorter proportions,
occur in Harl. MS. Y. 6. (engraved Hewitt,
vol. i, p. 127), written at the end of the twelfth
century, and one clearly shows the curved formation
which is indicated in numberless seals and
illuminations of this date.</p>

<p>The inscriptions are in Latin and in longobardic
characters, but Gothic letters are sometimes alternated,
while in others plain Roman capitals still
occur. I have noticed one remarkable instance of
an inscription of this century, in Norman-French,
around the seal of Alanus fil. Adam, temp. Henry II.
The deed to which it is attached is printed in
<cite>Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica</cite>, vol. v, p. 116.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3 class="break">THIRTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>In the earliest years of this century Norman
shields curved round the body still continue; while
in seals, which at this date are our principal source
of evidence, animals, such as dragons, appear to
fill up the field, and especially to support a plain
shield in large counterseals; also distinctive badges
are introduced, such as cinquefoils, estoiles, mascles,
boars' heads, lions, &amp;c.; but sometimes in character
they follow greatly the pattern obtaining at the end
of the twelfth century. "Heater-pear"
No. 6
occurs, and frequently such a
shield stands in the centre of a
circular seal, merely surrounded
by the inscription in longobardic.
The heater shield is now rather
more pointed than it appears
in later examples.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img  src="images/i_028.jpg" width="200" height="232" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>A very curious triangular shield
No. 1 also now appears, as in
the seal of Johannes fil. Galfridi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
de Edinton, such a triangular shield on a plain
circular field, around which is the inscription, in
plain Roman capitals. This is engraved in the
<cite>Visit. Hunts.</cite>, 1613, p. 100. Another seal, Nigellus
de Amundeville, is entirely three-cornered, a little
longer than an equilateral triangle; the shield is of
the same contour, and shows three chevrons, while
the edging leaves space for the inscription round
the three sides. This is also engraved in the <cite>Visit.
of Huntingdon, 1613</cite>, p. 121, published by the
Camden Society. This shape of triangular seal
seems to have been more common than was
supposed. The curious seal of the Treverbin family
of Cornwall is engraved, <cite>Archæological Journal</cite>,
vol. x, p. 150; but, as it shows no shield, it stands
outside our present subject.</p>

<p>Another curious shield is figured in Nicholas
Upton, <cite>De Usu Militari</cite>, Bisse edition, 1654, p. 37,
and of date 1257 (see No. 47). Henry de Fernbureg
stands with a square shield in his left hand. It is
about two feet long, considerably curved, and
appears to be very thick. In his right hand he
holds a hammer extending into a sharp spike at
the back. Square shields very much like this,
but more oblong in shape, and with a round boss
projecting from the middle, occur in the very
curious illustration of a wager of duel in the
Miscel. Rolls, temp. Henry III., and therefore of
date 1210-50. Each duellist carries such a shield;
they must be over two feet long, and are much
curved; while with the other hand he wields an
awkward looking hammer, or more properly a pick,
as it is pointed at both ends; while, after the
manner of ancient pictures, the vanquished (and
therefore the guilty one) is seen hanging up in the
background. This is engraved in Hewitt's <cite>Ancient
Armour</cite>, vol. i, p. 375, also in Madox's <cite>History of the
Exchequer</cite>, p. 383.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
	<img src="images/i_030a.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="men fighting, hanged man" />
</div>

<p>In the very curious instance of the seal of
Thomas Furnival, his arms are shown in a lozenge-shaped
shield. This is of date 1274-9, and is
engraved in <cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. iii, p. 334.
Even at this early date such a shape seems to have
been usually reserved for ladies. Sir George
Mackenzie [quoted in Guillim's <cite>Display</cite>, ed. 1724]
mentions that Muriell, Countess of Stratherne,
bore her arms in a lozenge in 1284.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_030b.jpg" width="250" height="251" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>Another very curious shield of Helie Count de
Maine is reproduced in Montfauçon's <cite>Monarchie
Française</cite>. This is a wedge-shaped
or triangular shield,
but the top has square corners
and is peaked (see No. 48).
The seal of Turstan Dispensator
Regis, about 1210,
shows the heater-pear with
the upper corners slightly
varied. This is engraved in
<cite>Collect. Top. et Gen.</cite>, vol. iv,
p. 239. The ancient arms
of Despencer are said to have been Ermine, a chief
Gules; but this seems to represent ... six
cloves, four and two, and a chief; and to fill up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the space three cinquefoils are introduced in the
field.</p>

<p>But, as before laid down, the general shapes of
shields in this century are the Norman No. 2, often
of very long proportions, as shown in William de
Longespee, Earl of Sarum, 1226, and the statues
at Wells Cathedral, 1230; the heater-pear No. 6,
and the plain heater No. 5, rather long and pointed.
A Clifford seal given in Nicholas Upton, p. 91, of
date 1220, has a heater-pear shield on the seal,
and an ordinary heater on the smaller counterseal
(see No. 49). We may remark that on the tomb of
Queen Eleanor, in Westminster Abbey, appears, on
a long-shaped heater shield, the first example of
quartering in England which just comes within
the limits of the thirteenth century. This represents
the two kingdoms of Castile and Leon, but
it was undoubtedly the example which afterwards
led to regular quarterings of arms by families.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that during the latter half of
this century shields begin to be shown in seals,
suspended by the guige, which is passed round a
tree or other device from which it can hang.</p>

<p>Flowers, leaves, and even architectural details,
enarching, &amp;c., now begin to appear, to fill up
the field, and the whole tone approaches the style
prevailing in the following century.</p>

<p>It may be as well to remark in this place that
milled, dotted, or roped lines around seals are
no indication of date. They appear in all these
varieties as early as William the Conqueror, and
extend to the latest times, according to the fancy
of the artist.</p>

<p>Inscriptions are in longobardic, with plain Latin
capitals often alternated; and in the seal of
Henry II. the letter R has a line across the tail,
signifying a contraction&mdash;<span class="smcap">HENR</span> for Henrici.</p>

<p>Until the end of this century a cross is used at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
beginning of the inscriptions, but about 1275 stars
appear, and in the next century trefoils and other
devices are frequently introduced instead of crosses.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3 class="break">FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>This century opens with that most valuable fund
of information the celebrated Baron's letter, 1301,
the seals attached to which are beautifully engraved
in the <cite>Monumenta Vetusta</cite> of the Society of Antiquaries,
vol. i, plates 28-33. A large number of
these show heater shields, some more and some
less pointed. The beautiful round seal of Simon
de Montacute shows a square shield, No. 7, with
a pointed French base; while to represent the
curving of the shield the top is concave. The side
spaces in the field, as is frequently the case with
seals of this date, are filled up with two grotesque
animals or worms, while in the place where a
crest would be appears a large castle, &amp;c. The
counterseal to this is square, representing a griffin
segreant, not in a shield at all, but surrounded by
a bordure.</p>

<p>Badges or portions of armorial bearings obtained
from heiresses now frequently appear on the fields,
to fill up; being the way in which such intermarriages
were shown before the general introduction
of quarterings. Flowers in the field, also
enarching and architectural details, are freely used
to fill up the blank spaces, and in one of the seals
attached to the Baron's letter&mdash;that of Hugo
Bardolf, of Wormgay (see No. 50)&mdash;no room is
left outside the architectural embellishment for an
inscription. Seals also occur shaped entirely like
a heater shield; with a similar shield in the centre
containing the arms, as in that of Matthew Fitz
John, where the three lions rampant appear, while
the space beyond is filled up with the inscribed
name of the owner. See No. 51.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_033a.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>The seals of this whole century are most
beautifully designed and executed, and almost
universally show the heater shape; pointed in the
earlier decades, and becoming
gradually shorter and more
square-shaped say about 1370.
The secretum of Robert
Braybroke, Bishop of London
1382-1401, well shows this
squareness. It is engraved in
the <cite>Proceedings of the Society
of Antiquaries</cite>, 9th Dec, 1869,
also 3rd Feb., 1887. To the
same deed, dated 21st May,
1392, is also attached the seal of Sir Gerard
Braibrok the younger.</p>

<div class="figright">
	<img src="images/i_033b.jpg" width="250" height="252" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>The fields are beautifully decorated,
being diapered or filled up
with architectural or ornamental
details&mdash;lines, dots, and flowers;
while frequently crests, with helmets
and mantlings, occur; and
sometimes two of such helmets
are placed as supporters on each
side of the shield, or two grotesque animals hold
up the helmet and crest, while the shield of arms
appears in the base.</p>

<p>Gothic lettering in the Latin inscriptions now
first appears,
although more frequently
longobardic, and occasionally
still the plain Roman
capitals. Frequently the whole
face of the seal is so filled up
that the only spaces left for the
inscription are on the edges,
above and below the arms. The
seal of Edmund of Arundel,
1301-26, shows this arrangement. It is from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. ii, p. 56. Now, also,
two, three, or more shields appear, conjointed or
standing side by side. The earliest instance I have
noticed is Sigillum Ide de Clinton, 1298-1300, with
three heater shields, points to the centre [Nicholas
Upton, p. 82]. Towards the middle of the century
they are frequently found.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="200" height="254" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>In the curious seal of Rich., fil. Ricardi de
Beyvill
of Wodewalton, which is heater-shaped,
and attached to a deed 1349,
a square heater shield shows a
chevron between three roundels, and
is supported by two worms or dragons,
while across the top of the
seal appears the name "Beyvil."
This is engraved <cite>Visit. Huntingdon</cite>,
p. 116.</p>

<p>Besides the curved heater of the last century,
which appears in the great seal of Edward II., 1307,
and in several monumental effigies, others of
Norman heater form No. 2 appear with the upper
corners cut off and sometimes rounded. Refer to
an effigy in Norton Church, Durham, engraved in
<cite>Surtees History</cite>, vol. iii, p. 155 (see No. 52), while
in illuminated MSS. shields occur with the bouche
deeply cut and the base of the shield curved
<em>outwards</em>. This curved outward turning will be
discussed while speaking of similar shields found
in the next century. Two which occur in Bamberg
Cathedral are engraved <cite>Archæological Journal</cite>, vol. ii,
p. 217, and in Hewitt's <cite>Armour</cite>, vol. ii, pp. 138-9, and
are specially curious (see No. 55); and several are
shown from Harl. MS. 14379, and engraved in
Cutts, p. 434.</p>

</div>

<p>Shields on monumental effigies almost, if not
entirely, disappear in the course of this century,
and in battles and tournaments in ancient MSS. of
this date the knights are more usually represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>without shields. Such is the fact; the reason
being that defensive armour had been added to and
improved, and increased in respect of weight, as
experiences of war showed the contingencies
against which it was desirable to be protected.
The shield, therefore, became an encumbrance to
the mounted knight, while so perfect was his case
of steel, and so admirably fitted and designed, that
the shield was no longer required. We notice that
this general discarding of shields by mounted
knights begins about the latter half of this
fourteenth century among the wealthy and powerful,
who could procure expensive and perfect suits of
mail. It is in memory of such only that costly
monumental effigies were erected, and, as a
consequence, the shields formerly shown carved by
the side of the knights now entirely disappear from
effigies. The reasons here put forward are quite
borne out by other evidences. Monumental brasses,
which now lend their assistance to our search, were
far less costly memorials than such effigies. Some
of the earliest of these represent the dead knight
as he appeared in his life, with, his shield upon the
arm; but in the course of the following fifteenth
century these, too, follow the fashion we find
prevailing in MS. illustrations, and the shields are
only used for the purposes of heraldry, and are
relegated into the corners of the brass, or up
among its tabernacle work.</p>

<p>While on this subject of suits of mail, I may with
advantage overstep the limits of this century&mdash;as,
indeed, I have already done&mdash;and mention that
such went on increasing so greatly in protective
perfectness, and, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i>, in their oppressive
weight, that a knight falling off the horse upon
which he had been placed lay perfectly helpless;
and history records many times that they were
slain by clowns and boys while lying helpless on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the ground. When the style of protective armour
became so exaggerated, a man so hampered could do
little more than hold his spear and guide his horse.
Until at last, about the year 1602, King James I.
summed up the past experience of armour thus:&mdash;"It
was an admirable invention, which preserved
a man from being injured,&mdash;and made him
incapable of injuring any one else."</p>

<p>In some books it is stated that the introduction
and gradually increasing use of gunpowder in war
led by degrees to the abandonment of shields;
but the above evidences completely refute such an
idea. Heavy mail armour, exaggerated into an
absurdity&mdash;as pointed out by King James&mdash;did so
disappear when it became evident that such
afforded no protection whatever against a small
bit of well-directed lead. But shields had already
been abandoned by the knights,&mdash;long before, at a
period when gunpowder was as yet a great and
rare mystery.</p>

<p>Besides, we find round shields were still in
continued use by the foot-soldiery, when every
battlefield was contested with fire and sword&mdash;the
smoke as well as the din of battle.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="200" height="263" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>Moreover, examples have come down to us of
such shields with fixed pistols projecting through,
and with a peep-hole for sighting. Thus shields were
made the handmaid
of gunpowder;
and, as a matter of fact, they were
in use by foot soldiers so late as the
middle of the seventeenth century.</p>



<p>We noticed that the heater shields
which obtained so largely during
this century, and grew less and less
pointed as it progressed, at last
became much squarer. The seal
of Edmund Mortimer, Earl of
March, 1372, might well be taken for the fifteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
century; the square heater, with blunt-shaped base;
the inscription in Gothic, and curiously placed
at the top and bottom; and the two supporting
helmets, with mantlings and huge panaches, out
of which appear below the hinder half of the bodies
and legs of two
animals, the rest
of their carcasses
being crammed inside
these helmets.
This is taken from
the engraving in
<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>,
vol. ii, p. 56.</p>

<div class="figright">
	<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="300" height="394" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>But from about
this date downwards
we can perceive
much more
discriminating
taste exercised in
designing seals.
The seal of Richard
Earl of Arundel,
1330-76, from the
engraving in
<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. ii, p. 54, is an example
of such beautiful design and execution.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>The small seal of Matilde Fraunceys, relict of
Simon Fraunceys, citizen of London, attached to
a deed 33 Edward III. [1359], is a characteristic
example of ordinary small well-executed
seals prevailing in this
century. The engraving is
from the <cite>Proceedings of Society
of Antiquaries</cite>, 11th Dec., 1856.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="230" height="332" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>Some families seem to have
taken a special pride in their
seals. Those of the Bardolfe
family of Wyrmegeye, Norfolk,
continue pre-eminent for several
generations. Occasionally one
member of a family shows a seal
of extreme beauty, the work of
some "Strongitharm" or "Wyon" of those days,
and in this way the centuries may frequently seem
to overlap each other. Such exceptional seals
show an execution, shape of shield frequently, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
design somewhat later than their art-date, in the
sequence we are endeavouring to
lay down. Other such overlappings
occur from the great age of the
seal user. Elianor Ferre uses on a
deed, 1348, a dimidiated seal, which
was surely made about 1290. She
died, a very old lady, in 1349. This
seal is engraved in <cite>Archæological
Journal</cite>, vol. xi, p. 375; and if you will refer to
<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. i, p. 485, you will see a
seal of Clare and Fitzgerald dimidiated on a shield
of apparently identical date. The inscription is
"Sigill-Elianore-Ferre"; so she used her own seal
made in early life, perhaps dating from her marriage.
The seal of Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of
Albemarle, used in 1292, is another dimidiated
heraldic seal, almost identical. See No. 53.</p>

<div class="figright">
	<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="200" height="211" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>Pointed heater shields with concave tops, suggesting
their curved shape, are not uncommon in
this century, and inscriptions in Gothic type became
much more frequent.</p>

<p>The description of a shield which used to hang,
before the Great Fire, in old St. Paul's, London,
will be an interesting illustration of how shields
were made in the fourteenth century. This was
the shield of John of Gaunt (or Ghent, as it was
originally spelled), our Duke of Lancaster, the
third brother of Edward the Black Prince, and
father of Henry IV. He was born 1340, and died
1399, so we may assign 1370 as about the date of
its manufacture. In shape it is an oblong square
with rounded corners and hollowed-out sides and
base, while a very deep bouche is cleft into the
dexter chief. It much resembles the "Gothic-rounded
No. 12," but the base is flat and hollowed
out. I am quoting from Bolton's <cite>Elements of
Armories, 1610</cite>, p. 69:&mdash;"It is very convex toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the bearer, whether by warping through age, or
as made of purpose. It hath in dimensions more
than three-quarters of a yeard of length and
above halfe a yeard in breadth: next to the body
is a canvas glew'd to a boord, upon that thin
board are broad thin axicles, slices or plates of
horne nail'd fast, and againe over them 20 and
sixe peeces of the like all meeting or centring
about a round plate of the same in the navell of
the shield, and over all a leather clozed fast to
them with glew or other holding stuffe,&mdash;upon
which his armorie was painted, but now they
with the leather itself have very lately and very
lewdly bin utterly spoil'd." This is engraved in
Bolton's <cite>Elements</cite>, in Willement's <cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>,
in Randle Holme's <cite>Academy</cite>, and in several other
heraldic works. There is also engraved in Bolton's
<cite>Elements</cite>, p. 67, the shield of Edward the Black
Prince hanging over his tomb at Canterbury. This
was of the egg shape No. 35; and in a circle in the
centre were, on a heater shield No. 5, the arms of
France and England quarterly with a label of three
points; while around this circle the rest of the
shield was embossed or "tooled" with an elaborate
filagree pattern, and a narrow plain rim extended
round the outer edge.</p>

<p>The inscriptions in this century continue to be
in Latin and in Roman letters, but sometimes
Gothic lettering is used.</p>

<h3 class="break">FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>Our materials for proof during this century are
peculiarly numerous and rich. There is great
store of beautiful seals, many of them highly
decorated, and preparing us for their decay and
disappearance after about 1490. Then again,
MS. illustrations of tournaments show the shaped
shields of the knights hung up on tents or elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and adorned with their heraldry; and
occasionally, and in one case as late as 1480, two
knights appear on horseback, jousting and bearing
shields; also, in some cases, combats on foot,
where the knights carry shields. We have also
stained glass with shields, which, at this early
time, seem more closely to follow the shapes of
those actually in use.</p>

<p>Grants of arms now begin to supply shapes of
shields, and towards the end of the century
printers' marks appear, although these last seem
to be affected by a fanciful exaggeration.</p>

<div class="center">
	<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="two men with horses" />
	<p class="center caption">Add. MS. 15,477&mdash;date 1360.</p>
</div>

<p>As a case of recrudescence of old ideas we must
refer to the instance of a bouche, in which to rest
the spear, so early as 1360, in Add. MS. 15,477,
in the British Museum (Hewitt, vol. ii, p. 231);
indeed one is represented vastly earlier, in 1159, in
the seal of Theodoric Count of Flanders, engraved
in Oliver Vredius, p. 17 (see No. 46). Such shields
are now very frequent, except upon seals, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
they seldom occur; and the reason is, no doubt,
that they would have interfered with the heraldic
charges, which now begin to be multiplied.</p>

<p>Heater shields, and sometimes pointed, just as
they appear at earlier dates, are still continued;
but in most cases, and especially towards the
middle and end of the century, they become much
more square and blunter at the base.</p>

<p>Seals of the more important families are filled
up with elaborate decorations&mdash;diapering on the
fields, leaves and mantlings filling up the whole
space, and supporting animals, finely and boldly
designed, are introduced; and several concentric
lines, differently ornamented, with quatrefoils,
crosses, mullets, and stars upon these circular
bands sometimes occur within the inscription.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="250" height="227" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>From about 1420 a custom began, and is occasionally
adopted in the larger seals, to represent as
scrolls those bands upon which the inscriptions of
name and title, &amp;c., were written, while the ends
were ornamentally unfolded and loose. To show
exactly what I mean
I would refer to the seal
of John de Clinton de
Say, 1438, No. 54, engraved
in <cite>Archæologia</cite>,
vol. xxxviii, p. 272, and
to that of Sir John
Pelham, 1469. This
is engraved in <cite>Archæological
Journal</cite>, vol. vii,
p. 323; the Sussex
Archæological Society's
vol. iii, p. 220;
also in <cite>Historical and Genealogical Notices of the
Pelham Family</cite>, privately printed in 1873 by the
late Mr. M. A. Lower.</p>

<p>Many of these seals are marvels of design and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
execution. At the very end of the century we
notice so much is sought to be represented that the
designs in consequence become flat and weak,
losing much of their character and boldness, and
thus preparing us for the startling change in the
following century. Another noticeable circumstance
is that such splendid and pretentious seals are not
confined to the greatest nobility or people of vast
territorial influence. Many untitled families towards
the end of the fifteenth century showed seals not
quite so large, but fully equal in workmanship and
beautiful design to those of the house of Lancaster,
the Nevilles, Lords of Abergavenny; the Dukes
of Buckingham, and other great titled nobles.
Through the kindness of Mr. H. S. Grazebrook
I am able to show the
seal of Richard Dudley of
Clapton, Northants; the
arms of Dudley quartering
Hotot [see William Salt
Society vol. x, p. 54].
This seal was exhibited
to the Heralds at their
Visitation of Northants,
1618, "antiquum Sigillum
argenteum," and is tricked
in their original MS. As
its date is between 1440 and 1475, I have no
doubt it was made for that Richard Dudley of
Clapton who "condidit testamentum" 1465.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>We must now take up those curiously curved
outward shields, alluded to as shown in Harl.
MS. 4379, of a date about 1360, see No. 55,
and again at Bamberg Cathedral, 1370 [page 24],
see No. 55<span class="smcap">A</span> and No. 55<span class="smcap">B</span>. We may lay it down as
an axiom that every alteration in the shapes of
shields at these early dates, and therefore for
actual use, arose from some apparent advantage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
be gained by it. Hewitt, vol. ii, p. 314, engraves
a curved shield, about the end of the fourteenth
century, from an ivory chessman. In the <cite>Archæological
Journal</cite>, vol. ix, p. 119, there is one, from
stained glass, of early in the fifteenth century. This
is a square parallelogram with a bouche, and the
top and bottom are projected forwards, while the
intermediate portion is flat. This shield is of
considerable thickness, see No. 56. In the statue
of Henry VI. at Westminster, of the date 1422, a
similar shield appears without any bouche, but
with the top and bottom ends similarly projected
and the middle portion flat, see No. 57. This
is engraved in Meyrick's <cite>Ancient Armour</cite>, plate 42.
A similar shield, from an ancient chest in York
Minster, is shown in the same book, vol. ii, at
p. 124. In the grant of arms to the Ironmongers'
Company, 1455, and in many other instances, a
bouched shield, deeply engrailed at top and bottom,
has both ends similarly projected, the middle portion
being curved, but to a lesser degree. This is
engraved in <cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. i, p. 37,
and the same shield of arms is illuminated in the
margin of the charter granted to the Ironmongers
in 1483. It seems evident that the intention in
thus hollowing out the face of the shield was to
receive and to retain the spear point with greater
certainty upon that part of the shield; as in combat
it was found to slip off above or below, and search
out for itself some dangerous resting place on the
helmet or other vulnerable part of the armour.
This shape could not readily be shown in front
view on seals, but such shields curved outwards
appear frequently with great clearness in illuminations
where a side view is commonly given, see an
engraving of men at arms in fourteenth century in
Cutts, p. 339. I am also able to show a most
interesting illumination of a knight of the fifteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
century bearing a very curious shield. This is
from Cutts, p. 398.</p>

<p>Round shields borne by foot soldiers appear
curved and bulged out in the same way. I
annex the representation of a soldier
with a spear and such a round
shield from Cotton MS. Claudius,
D. ii, fol. 30. This dates from the
earlier part of the fourteenth century,
and is engraved in Hewitt, vol. ii, p.
114. This formation is apparently
meant to give strength, and to ensure
a cut or thrust gliding off, rather
than resting upon the shield.</p>

<div class="figleft">
	<img src="images/i_048b.jpg" width="200" height="365" alt="man with shield and spear" />
</div>

<p>The reasons for some other alterations
are not so apparent; for
instance, in the seal of Ralph Shelton,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1460, see No. 58, a curious projecting point
is shown in the right hand base [called sinister
in heraldry] of the shield, and a similar projection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
occurs in the beautiful escutcheon of Elizabeth of
York, wife of Henry VII., 1485, see No. 59, engraved
in Willement's <cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>. A stone carving of
a bouche, with a very similar formation and of the
same date, and bearing the Tilney arms, is found
upon Shelly Hall, Suffolk, and is etched in the
Anastatic Drawing Society's volume for 1871. It
seems probable this was originally meant to protect
some part of the left leg
or ankle which was liable
to be injured in combat.
Another shield here shown
gives with great clearness
this curious point. It is
engraved in Mr. Cutts'
book, p. 402, and taken
from Harl. MS. 4925, fo.
cxxx. This, however, is too
small to protect the leg.</p>

<div class="figright">
	<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="250" height="397" alt="two knights" />
</div>

<p>Many shields now occur
with hollowed-out sides,
and engrailed at the top
and base, and are classed
in our plate under the
various forms of Gothic
(Nos. 9 to 12). Sometimes
the top is straight,
while the sides and base are engrailed out, and in
instances, perhaps under German influence, the
bases are rounded. The endless variety of these
beautiful Gothic shields is most fascinating. The
wonder is that they lasted for so very short a time,
from the middle of this fifteenth century to the first
few decades of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>In Cutts' valuable book, p. 454 (see No. 59), two
unmounted knights, from an engraving by Hans
Burgmaier, are represented in combat, about 1450,
carrying two very curious shields, somewhat similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in idea to these Gothic shields. Being divided
lengthways into three partitions; both are broader
at the top and narrowed at the lower end, and they
seem to be about 3 feet 6 inches long. One is
convex at the top and engrailed, with a bluntly-pointed
base; the other is flat but slightly engrailed,
and the rounded base somewhat broken by the three
divisions, which evidently suggest that these shields
were curved round the body. But the old plain
heater continues as by far the most prevalent
shape throughout this century. It is usually
very square, and in several instances there is an
approach to the French base of Mr. Rylands'
nomenclature.</p>

<p>As already remarked, foot soldiers of all ages,
down to the middle of the eighteenth century,
appear with round shields. During this century
and the next these are shown with handsome
decorations, but never with heraldry on the face:
foot soldiers, perhaps, were not considered heraldically
armigerous. In an Italian painting of this
century, foot soldiers are represented with square
and diamond shaped shields, each side shaped
out in curves; and in one heraldry is painted;
perhaps he was a dismounted knight and the
others only retainers. This may be seen engraved
in Jacquemart's <cite>History of Furniture</cite>, p. 24
(see No. 60).</p>

<p>In many other shields at the end of this century
the heater shape has gradually arrived at what is
named square No. 7, and in the charter granted to
the waxchandlers, 1484 (see No. 61), and in many
other instances, these shields were very long in
proportion to their width. The same elongated
shape appears in a shield on Christ Church gate,
Canterbury, date 1517; engraved <cite>Archæologia</cite>,
vol. xvi, p. 194.</p>

<h3 class="break oldeng">Mantlings.</h3>

<p>The first observed instance of a mantling or
lambrequin, as it was then called,&mdash;a term still
applied to it by the modern French heralds,&mdash;occurs
in the large seal of Ralph de Monthermer,
Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, 1299. This is
engraved in Nicholas Upton, <cite>De Usu Militari</cite> [Bisse
edition, 1654, p. 63]. In Planché's <cite>Poursuivant</cite>
the helmet and mantling alone are engraved from
this seal. It is represented as a square handkerchief
or shawl fastened at one end under the crest, and
flying out loose behind. There is no hacking (see
No. 62). Ralph de Monthermer was a "plain
esquire," but attracted the attention and secured
the love of Joan of Acres, daughter of Edward I.
and relict of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester.
May we be allowed to fancy we see here the
kerchief of the fair lady whose favour led to his
advancement, and whose marriage eventually
brought him his title? His second wife was also
a widow, namely, the relict of John de Hastings
and sister of Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke.</p>

</div>


<p>In Planché's <cite>Poursuivant</cite> is engraved another
very similar, from the seal of Thomas, Earl of
Lancaster (see No. 63). He was beheaded by
Edward II. (1321). This seems to be of some
thick material and bordered. It is better shown in
the full-sized engraving in Sandford's <cite>Genealogical
History</cite>, p. 102. Boutell (<cite>Heraldry</cite>, p. 212) describes
No. 64 as a "contoise," and says it was used until
the middle of the fourteenth century. These seem
to have been stiff to stand out, but I have not found
representations of any more of them. Mr. Boutell
refers to two effigies showing them in Exeter
Cathedral, and another in Westminster Abbey. In
the seal of John de Tilneye to a deed, 1353
[engraved in the <cite>Visit. Hunts.</cite>, p. 29], a voluminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and square folded mantling, without any hacks, is
extended out to the inscription on each side, and is
fixed under a broad-brimmed
hat which stands on the top
of the helm, and on this hat is
the crest, viz., a tree supported
by two lions gambs. There
is another instance on the
monument at Norton Brize,
Oxfordshire, to John Daubygné,
1346, where the mantling
is extended out square in folds,
without any hacking, and hangs
on each side of the helmet, while below is placed
the shield. This is engraved in Boutell's <cite>Heraldry</cite>,
p. 156 (see No. 65). Another such squarely-folded
and unhacked mantle is shown on the seal of
Elizabeth de Lucy, 1354, with a man's helmet
and crest (!!)&mdash;see No. 66&mdash;and yet another in
that of Sir William de Lucy, 1392. Both of
these are engraved in Nicholas Upton, p. 73
(see No. 67). But these must all be taken as
rare exceptions. Usually mantlings of so early
a date as the fourteenth century are of very small
dimensions, hacked and lying close on their helmets,
clinging to them, as it were, and so fastened under
the crest that they could not hang otherwise. As
we see in the seal of Richard, Earl of Arundel,
about 1350-70 (illustrated at p. 27), also in the
seals of Sir Thomas Bysshe, 1381 [Nicholas Upton,
p. 53], see No. 68; and in that of John de Clinton,
1386 [Nicholas Upton, p. 82], see No. 69; but
seals of the fourteenth century more commonly
show no mantlings: they were only just beginning
to be introduced.</p>

<div class="figright">
	<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="200" height="248" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>At the beginning of the fifteenth century the
same small hacked mantlings, hanging closely upon
their helmets, still continue, and become the rule;
it was the exception to have any mantling at all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the fourteenth. About 1420, however, they begin
to spread over the field of the seal, in free and bold
curves and waves. In the seal of John, Lord
Clinton de Say, 1438 (No. 54), and in that of
Humphrey, Earl of Stafford and Perche, 1438,
both engraved <cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xxxviii, p. 272,
they are seen hacked, wandering away from the
helm, and half way down the shield. But a noteworthy
characteristic of the mantlings of this early
date, and one to which I must draw your particular
attention, is that, although stretching their arms
boldly about the field, and in MSS. where space
will allow, they may extend down below the base of
the shield, they are not, perhaps never, seen to
<em>hide themselves behind it</em>! The spirit of those old
times when the mantling would probably be the
gift of some fair lady, perhaps her kerchief or
mantle, and borne with chivalrous fervour through
the many adventures in which the knight of those
days sought to gain fame and experience&mdash;this spirit
of honouring the mantlet still remained burning
brightly; a fold was therefore too precious to be
hidden behind the shield. When we come to
consider such decorations in
later times, when such sentiment
had departed, you will
see why [beyond the valuable
indication of date supplied]
I have drawn your attention
particularly to this peculiarity
to be noted in the fifteenth
century. The seal of Thomas
Strange, 1419, shows a curious
arrangement of mantling.
This is engraved in <cite>Miscell.
Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>, 1884, p. 59. In the very
curious and interesting seal of Sir John Pelham,
1469, engraved in <cite>Archæological Journal</cite>, vol. vii,
p. 323, and already illustrated on p. 32, the field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the seal is filled up with bold contortions of the
hacked mantling, while on the helmet appears the
most extraordinary crest&mdash;a large birdcage which
is higher than the helmet itself; it is divided into
three tiers of wickerwork, and has a pointed roof,
while on the field appear two buckles. Sir John
Pelham, at Poictiers in 1356, personally assisted at
the capture of the French King, when the honorary
distinction of the buckle as a family badge was
accorded to him. His descendants sometimes used
the birdcage crest, in remembrance of the same
exploit and the imprisoned king.</p>

<p>In illuminations of this date, say of the latter
half of the fifteenth century, we see the same
characters&mdash;the mantlings so divided into narrow
ribbon-like folds, much hacked and twisted to
show the lining, and thrown out into bold arms
around the shield and extending some way below
it with fine artistic effect. I would refer to the
grant of arms to the Fellowship of Ironmongers
of London, 1st September, 1455, already illustrated
on p. 35, also to the shield of Edward IV., 1460,
in Willement's <cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>. There are also
two beautiful specimens engraved in Boutell's
<cite>Brasses</cite>; one, the stall plate at Windsor of Sir
Humphrey Stafford, K.G., 1460, at p. 219 (see
No. 70), and at p. 207 the brass of Sir William
Say, at Broxbourne, Herts, 1473 (see No. 71): the
mantling in the last ends in four tassels; this
addition of tassels becomes the ordinary usage in
the MS. illuminations and in grants of arms, but
not in seals of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>I refer to No. 72 for the lithograph of that very
curious mantling carved in stone at Wyverton,
Nottinghamshire (Thoroton's <cite>History</cite>, p. 98), which
displays <em>three</em> tassels. This stands with two other
helmets, each over its respective shield of heraldry,
and on examination I am able to declare their date
to be about 1440-50.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Licence of free warren and to make a park here
was granted 24 Henry VI. (1445), at which time
Thoroton supposes this house was built.</p>

<p>Following our entirely different lines of enquiry,
I am able to state, to within twenty or thirty years,
the date of these carvings; and I would further
say that as to one of the quarterings displayed,
the Chaworth family did not inherit the right to
bear it until 1422; thus confirming very exactly
Thoroton's date.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first appearance of a tassel on a
mantling is on a monument to &mdash; Harsyck in
Southacre Church, Norfolk, 1384; engraved in
Boutell's <cite>Heraldry</cite>, plate I (see No. 73). This is
also interesting as being a very early example of
the wreath or torse which supports the crest,
consisting of a twisted cord of silk of two colours.
In a brass to Sir Hugh Hastings, at Elsing,
co. Norfolk, 1347, the same is shown. In the
effigy of Sir Richard Pembruge, 1375, now in the
nave of Hereford Cathedral, the crest and helmet
are attached with a wreath of leaves, above which
rises a great panache of feathers.</p>

<p>The earliest instance of a <em>date</em> upon the face of
a shield is said to occur about the middle of the
thirteenth century, but such are very uncommon
until the sixteenth century, when they are found
both on personal and official seals.</p>

<p>The inscriptions on English seals of this fifteenth
century are almost universally in Latin and in
Gothic lettering. I have, so far, only noted one
seal with Roman letters, and that occurs in 1403.</p>

<h3 class="break">SIXTEENTH AND FOLLOWING CENTURIES.</h3>



<p>Before entering upon our subject during this
period, it is necessary to consider the great changes,
social and legal, which passed over England from
say 1450 to the end of the reign of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Events for thirty years before the accession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Henry VII. (1485) had been gradually reducing
the power of the nobility. Enactments had been
passed which facilitated the transfer of lands; and
the disastrous wars of the Roses, in which the
blood of the nobility flowed like water, brought
also the dispersion of a large portion of their
estates, and the consequence was that when
Henry VII. began his reign, and the conflicts
between the rival Houses of York and Lancaster
were completely hushed [say 1485], he found
himself in possession of the sole power. The
great nobles who had hampered the actions of his
predecessors had disappeared from the scene. At
his first Parliament Henry VII. only summoned
twenty-eight peers; and so gradually did this class
recover itself that we find at the first Parliament
of Henry VIII. only thirty-eight peers were
summoned to attend.</p>

<p>We can thus understand how those seals of
exceeding size and magnificence, which we found
prevailing during the middle and third quarter of
the fifteenth century, entirely disappear. The
greater nobility, as an assertion of their dignity
and importance, had then attached to their charters
seals of great pretensions, and gradually increasing
in size until, as Sandford [<cite>Genealogical History</cite>,
p. 108] remarks of those of the Dukes of Lancaster,
they rivalled or even exceeded in size what were used
by the crown itself. Had their embarrassed affairs
allowed them to enter again into mutual rivalry,
the stern government of Henry VII. would have
regarded such an assumption of dignity as treason to
the throne, and therefore we can fix the date 1485 for
the disappearance of such large and splendid seals.
Only occasionally do they continue to appear, and
within the limit of ten years after this time.</p>

<p>The landed gentry, the descendants in many
instances of a much earlier feudal aristocracy, had
suffered almost as much from the rivalries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
conflicts which had devastated the country. They,
too, laboured under the same depression and
necessity for retirement; and hence, if we take up
a bundle of deeds, say of the third quarter of the
fifteenth century, we shall find them loaded with
large and beautiful seals, while in a similar parcel,
dated early in the sixteenth, small bits of wax only
are found, many of them bearing one or more
initials, or a crest surrounded by a circle of large
dots, and the coats of arms, which do occur, are
altogether small and insignificant: in fact, personal
seals are now reduced in size to what may be
conveniently hung on a watch chain, or worn as
a somewhat large signet ring. I annex some
heraldic seals just to show what after this time are
looked upon as unusually fine. They are a very
great contrast to those we have been considering.</p>

<p>But still further reasons have to be considered.
The ancient form of drawing charters was gradually
disappearing, which after declaring the transaction,
ended with the all-important seal, put on in the
presence of such responsible witnesses as could be
got together, and who were afterwards always to be
found to come forward and vouch for the transaction.
Writing also now, early in the sixteenth century,
was becoming much more common, and the sense
of the nation showed that a deed signed and sealed
by the parties was much more satisfactory than
any number of witnesses, the limit of whose
testimony was bounded by that of their lives. I am
only putting into few words what is ably pointed
out by Williams in his work on <cite>Real Property</cite>,
ed. 1882, p. 153, and by Blackstone in his <cite>Commentaries</cite>,
ed. 1823, book ii, p. 305. But the curious
thing is that this change seems to have gradually
taken place without any enactment directing it.
The Statute of Frauds and Perjuries, 29 Charles II.
(1677-8, cap. 5), is the first instance where it
is expressly declared by act of Parliament that all
devises of lands or tenements must be in writing
and signed by the party and three or four credible
witnesses. Such had already been occasionally
the practice for at least two hundred years, for
I find a deed of gift of Thomas Hoo to the Abbot
of the Monastery of Battle is thus established
"Sigillum meum, una cum subscriptione propria
manu et signo manuali apposito"; the date is
21st September, 1480 [Thorpe's <cite>Battle Abbey Deeds</cite>,
1835, p. 124]. Occasional instances occur of the
old system of sealing only before a number of
witnesses, but after say 1520 the almost universal
method of executing deeds was by sign manual
and seal, and two or three attesting witnesses.</p>

<p>The earliest instance I have noticed of executing
a deed by sign manual is as above, in 1480. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
latest which I have met with, in which the ancient
form of execution had been followed, is a charter
printed in the Salop Archæological Society's vol. x,
p. 222:&mdash;"Thomas Scriven, armig., grants a yearly
payment of 8/ sterling out of his meadow at
Coleham, juta sive prope Ville Salop, hiis testibus
&amp;c. &amp;c., dat. Salop 25th Sept., 10 Henry VIII.,
1518"; but probably yet later instances may be
found.</p>



<p>The further reason, lying at the root of the
whole matter, was the wonderful expansion of trade,
wealth, and intelligence which broke upon England
at this time,&mdash;the English renaissance, as it is
called, and which culminated in the brilliant
company of poets and authors of Elizabeth's reign.
Following upon the breaking-up of the old nobility,
and the resumption of peace at home, wealth was
rapidly accumulated by many self-made men, and
by many younger sons of old families, who entered
into trade. These purchased lands and became the
county gentry. So expansive was this spirit of trade,
that ancient towns like York, Chester, Lancaster,
Coventry, and Lincoln, where long-established
guilds restricted trading to the burghers alone,
fell off in population and importance, while new
districts without such restrictions, such as Manchester
and Birmingham, as rapidly increased. In
an act, 33 Henry VIII., c. 15 [1541], it is stated
that the people of Manchester were then "well set
to work in making of cloths, as well of linen
as of woollen, whereby the inhabitants of the
said town have gotten and come into riches and
wealthy livings: and by reason of great occupying,
good order, strict and true dealing of the inhabitants
of the said town, many strangers, as well of
Ireland as of other places, had resorted thither."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
	<p class="plate">Plate V.</p>
	<a href="images/i_063_big.jpg">
	<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="346" height="600" alt="Plate V" />
	</a>
</div>

<p>Over all this boiling-up of busy-ness sat Henry VII.
and Henry VIII., as almost irresponsible sovereigns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and out of it grew the Commons of England!
The population meantime increased with wonderful
strides. In 1377 the population of England and
Wales did not exceed 2,500,000. By the military
musters, taken 1574-5, there were 1,172,674 of
able men for service, which it is estimated would
give a total population of about 4,700,000. This
astonishing revolution of trade and learning is so
remarkable that I must quote a portion of what old
Harrison says on the changes he had noticed
within fifty years. His most curious <cite>Description of
Britain</cite> was printed with Hollingshed's <cite>Chronicle</cite> in
1586, but was probably written some ten years
earlier: an exacter date I have not yet been able to
fix. "There are old men yet dwelling in the
village where I remaine which have noted three
things to be marvellouslie altered in England
within their sound remembrance: and other three
things too, too much increased. One is the multitude
of chimnies latelie erected, whereas in their
young daies there were not abouve two or three,
if so many, in most uplandish townes of the
realme [the religious houses and manor places of
their lords alwaies excepted, and peradventure
some great personages], but eche one made his
fire against a reredosse in the haull where he
lived and dressed his meat; secondly, the bedding
[now feathers and comfort, &amp;c., then straw or wood
only, &amp;c.]; thirdly, the exchange of vessells as of
treene platters into pewter, and wooden spoones
into silver or tin. So common were all sorts of
treene stuff in old time, that a man should
hardlie find four pieces of pewter [of which one
was peradventure a salt] in a good farmer's
house, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Whereas, in my time,
altho' peradventure £4 of old rent be improved to
£40, £50 or £100, yet will the farmer, as another
palm or date tree, think his gaines verie small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>toward the end of his term if he have not six or
seven years' rent lieng by him, therewith to
purchase a new lease, besides a faire garnish of
pewter on his cupbord, with so much more in od
vessell going about the house, three or four
feather bedds, so many coverlids and carpets of
tapistrie, a silver salt, a bowle for wine [if not
an whole neast], and a dozzen of spoones to
furnish up the sute."</p>

<p>But, alas, there is another side to all this national
prosperity. From this time, also, agriculturists&mdash;required
in fewer numbers under the new styles of
cultivation (which aimed at grazing and the production
of wool)&mdash;crowded into the towns in hope
of work, and large portions of the population began
to sink into the lowest depths of poverty.</p>



<p>In our researches as to the shapes of shields we
have now, therefore, lost that rich body of evidence
supplied by the seals on charters, which extended
to nearly the end of the fifteenth century, and the
MS. pictures of knights and tournaments. The
evidences now available consist of pedigrees, the
smaller heraldic seals attached to documents and
deeds, heraldic visitations and grants of arms,
printed books on heraldry, which begin 1496,
stained glass, the stone carvings on buildings,
tombs, and ledger stones, and, from the end of the
seventeenth century or a little earlier, book-plates.
Coins, too, now prove of some value to us, showing
what were prevailing types of shields.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as there were no shields actually
in use, the shapes prevailing now became entirely
a matter of fashion and taste. Randle Holme
prints sixty-five varieties of shields, and remarks
(p. 10 in his <cite>Academy of Armoury</cite>, Chester,
1688):&mdash;"But [as to the former shield] so to
this, a question may be made, whether such
an one was used by him, or only the invention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the cutter? If so, then the shapes and forms
of shields, targets, and bucklers would be as
many as carvers, stone cutters, engravers, and
painters please." Gerard Legh gets the credit
of having greatly multiplied, in his <cite>Accedens of
Armoury</cite>, 1562, the fanciful shapes of shields; and
later writers on heraldry seem to have followed
him. [<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. i, p. 191.] But
an examination of the <cite>Wappenbüch</cite>, published in
Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and similar heraldic drawings of Italian
coats, have opened out to me a vastly wider field
for variety than old Randle Holme ever supposed.
I have before me a copy of <cite>Virgil Solis</cite>, which was
published at Nurnberg in 1555. This contains
hundreds of coats, in shields of an endless variety
of shapes and great boldness of design; and when
we come to critically compare these shields with
one another, we discover that their outlines depend
upon the charges! These were <em>first</em> laid down
with grotesque boldness, and the outline of the
shield to bear them was then drawn around them,
to the artist's fancy of what best suited the
bearings and would most reduce the amount of
empty field. This is, after all, only reversing the
ancient method, where a lion was distorted to suit
a pointed heater; and it is suggested that a pale,
for a similar reason, might sometimes be pointed
into a pile. With this revelation from <cite>Virgil Solis</cite>,
we can detect that the same method of designing
prevails elsewhere. We must therefore multiply
Randle Holme's carvers, stone cutters, engravers,
and painters by the possible variety of their
fancies, and then multiply the quotient by the
number of all the heraldic bearings&mdash;plus all the
positions and forms they may be made to assume&mdash;if
we wish to arrive at the variety of shields possible
during the period we are now about to consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>In deference to this unanswerable position, I
find it necessary to alter entirely the classification
pursued in the earlier centuries&mdash;to take Mr.
Rylands' drawings seriatim, and to give for each
shape the earliest and latest dates at which, in my
limited researches, I have found them in use. This
method of treatment eliminates from our enquiry
all strictly fanciful shields which did not gain a
hold on public taste, and leaves us still with a
sufficiently heavy list of variations to which it is
possible, from their frequent recurrence, to attach
the dates.</p>

<p>A few leading remarks on points bearing on our
subject will prove useful at this stage of our enquiry.</p>



<p>Before watches became common, seals were
sometimes attached to the arms, like bracelets.
In <cite>Mercurius Rusticus</cite>, No. 30 (for 19/20 July,
1660), an advertisement appears for "a gold seal,
being a coat of arms, cut in a piece of gold, in
the form of a lozenge, fastened to a black
ribband to tye about the wrist." In the <cite>Visitation
of Essex, 1634</cite> [Harleian Society, p. 455],
appears the following certificate:&mdash;"This coate is
certiffied by Thomas Scott to bee by him seen
on a seale some 40 years since, and to be the
seale of armes of Thomas Moore Esq. father of
the said Hunting Moore, and that Robert Scott
his father did weare the same about his neck in
a scarffe about xx yeares&mdash;in witnes whearof
I have sett to my hand. Tho. Scott." [Robert
Scott had married Anne, daughter of Richard
Hunting and relict of Thomas Moore, of Orsett,
co. Essex.] This seal was, of course, a ring.</p>

<p class="breakaft">Watches, which naturally suggest small attached
seals, were, however, in pretty general use in
Queen Elizabeth's reign. In Shakespeare's <cite>Twelfth
Night</cite>, Malvolio says:&mdash;"I frown the while, and
perchance <em>wind up my watch</em>, or play with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

<h3 class="break">LINES FOR TINCTURES.</h3>



<p class="nobreak">The first English examples of seals with lines in
the engraving, to indicate the tinctures, are said to
be on some of those attached to the death warrant
of Charles I., 1648-9 [Planché's <cite>Pursuivant of Arms</cite>].
Now, as this system was unquestionably first
devised by Father Silvester de Petra Sancta&mdash;whose
two books, <cite>L'Armorial ou la Science du Blason</cite>, 4to,
and <cite>Soumaire Armorial</cite>, 4to, were both published in
Paris 1638&mdash;it seems curious that within ten years
we should find such conventional lines in use in
England; and it follows, also, that such of these
seals as were so treated in 1648 must all have been
recently cut! A diagram, showing the colours so
indicated, is given by Sir Edward Bysse in his
edition of Nicholas Upton's work, <cite>De Usu Militari</cite>,
published in 1654. The earlier works on heraldry,
which I have been able to consult, have the illustrations
in somewhat rough wood blocks&mdash;it would have
been difficult and expensive at that time to have got
finer work in wood; but we must remember that
Sylvanus Morgan, in his <cite>Armilogia</cite>, published 1666,
refers to Silvester de Petra Sancta's Epistles, and
elaborately describes&mdash;as if they were something
quite startling and new&mdash;why the several conventional
lines were selected. John Gibbon, in his
<cite>Introductio ad Latinam Blazoniam</cite>, published London
1682, p. 152, says, "for the distinction of colours
in arms [which was devised by the Rev. Father
S. de Petra Sancta]," and he (Gibbon) frames
some Latin verses for the better remembering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thereof; but in the woodcuts which adorn his book
he does not follow the system which he recommends.
The earliest English book which shows
them in the copper plate engravings is Bysse's
edition of Nicholas Upton, published, as already
noticed, in 1654. I am aware that Boutell, in his
<cite>Heraldry</cite>, chap. v, says that such lining may be
occasionally found before 1630. Now there seems
no manner of doubt as to the inventor; and any
references with dates, which Mr. Boutell could
have given, would have been valuable indeed! At
present we are involved in a paradox: if Father
Silvester invented the idea; did he discuss it for
years, perhaps before committing it to print, and
having his own beautiful copper plate illustrations
so drawn in 1638? I point out this interesting
question. Any instance of a seal or engraving so
treated with the proper lines to represent tinctures
and occurring before 1638 should be carefully noted
with the exact dates; and I venture to think any
such solitary instance would prove to be purely
accidental. The seal of Sir Edward Nicholas,
secretary to Charles II., engraved for him by the
celebrated Thomas Simon, does not show any
tincture lines (see the woodcut at p. 45). In this
seal the second and third quarters are the paternal
arms of Nicholas, while in the first and fourth are
displayed that honourable augmentation granted
to Sir Edward in 1649. We may safely conclude
that this seal was cut immediately after he received
that distinction. Particulars of Sir Edward's
career may be learned from Manning and Bray's
<cite>History of Surrey</cite>, vol. iii, p. 40; also from Hoare's
<cite>South Wiltshire</cite>, p. 88. He was Secretary to
Charles I., followed Charles II. into exile, and was
continued by him in his post of Secretary. He
eventually returned with him, and died in 1669,
at the age of seventy-seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>I regret I have never had the opportunity to
examine for myself the original death-warrant
which was carried out on that chill thirtieth day
of January, 1648-9; and so I am not able to say
with exactness which of the seals show tincture
lines, as it is said they do.</p>


<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3 class="oldeng break">Chaplets or Wreaths.</h3>



<p>About the end of the fifteenth century, arms are
frequently found surrounded by a wreath of laurel
or bay leaves, usually, at this date, divided into four
parts by ribbands. Menestrier gives the date 1480
as the earliest instance he has found [his most
learned works seem too little known by English
heralds: the <cite>Origine des Armoiries</cite> was published
in Paris 1679, and the <cite>Origine des Ornemens des
Armoiries</cite> in Paris 1680]. We see an example in
the tomb of Margaret, Countess of Richmond,
1509, in Westminster Abbey (engraved Sandford's
<cite>Genealogical History</cite>, 1677, p. 326)&mdash;see No. 74.
We find similar wreaths or garlands in Sylvanus
Morgan's <cite>Sphere of Gentry</cite>, published 1661, vol. i,
p. 22, and vol. ii, p. 68; and engravings of several
fanciful varieties are also there given. Wreaths of
olive, formed of two branches tied at the top and
bottom with ribbands, appear several times surrounding
coats of arms in W. Hollar's beautiful
engravings in Thoroton's <cite>History of Nottinghamshire</cite>,
published 1677 (see pages 199, 200, 203, 310, 486
and 487).</p>

<p>After a while, such wreaths were frequently
introduced in the outer edge surrounding official
and also personal round seals, and so arranged
that they more resemble bell-shaped flowers of
three leaves (like the side view of blue bells),
and without any dividing ribbands. The annexed
wood-cut of the Statute Merchants' seal of Carlisle,
1670, will show this. This seal was in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
halves to be kept in separate custody, and when
used, these were screwed together into a handle to
make it complete before affixing to any deed. The
seal and handle are here shown from the
engraving in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries,
16th May, 1889. Throughout the eighteenth
century, the blue bell ornament appears in corporate
seals, and book-plates about 1800 are found
surrounded by such oval bell-flowered wreaths.</p>

</div>

<p>Menestrier [<cite>Origine des Ornemens</cite>, published 1680]
writes:&mdash;"Now [<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aujourd'hui</i>] persons of quality,
particularly married ladies [<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femmes</i>], place two
palms together on the escutcheon of their arms,
which makes an agreeable ornament, and is, at the
same time, the symbol of conjugal love, which the
ancients have represented by the palms, male and
female." The earliest instance I have noted in
England is on the cups of Sir E. B. Godfrey, who
died in 1678 [engraved in <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>,
1848, and in <cite>Topographer and Genealogist</cite>, vol. ii,
p. 467]. They occur beneath a shield of Bridgeman,
Bart. (the plain arms not impaled), in
Sandford's <cite>Genealogical History</cite>, 1677, p. 228; also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
on a monumental slab, 1671, engraved in <cite>Miscell.
Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>, 1884, vol. i, p. 151. About
1765 we see two palms extensively used as decorations
below Georgian shields (see the plates in
Dugdale's <cite>Warwickshire</cite>, 1765; Hasted's <cite>Kent</cite>,
1778; Rudder's <cite>Gloucestershire</cite>, 1779; and Hutchin's
<cite>Dorsetshire</cite>, 1774). Such are extensively seen
throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
and were frequently painted, as a pleasing
decoration, below the arms on carriage panels,
almost to our own times. But they must have
lost the original
symbolism, for they
occur constantly on
ledger tombs [see
<cite>Miscell. Genealogica
et Heraldica</cite>, Mar.,
1885, p. 233; dated
1696], and must
then refer to the
resurrection life.
They are found in
book-plates in the
middle of the eighteenth
century, and
continue down to
1800 or later. The
ledger tomb to
Ashley Palmer and
his wife at Hawstead, dated 1792, shows a
pleasing example. This engraving is from <cite>Miscell.
Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>, 1885, p. 307.</p>


<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3 class="oldeng break">Supporters.</h3>



<p>It is hard to say when we may so name the
grotesque animals, which first appeared to fill up
the fields in seals even earlier than the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
century&mdash;see that of Ralph de Monthermer, Earl
of Gloucester and Hertford, 1299 [engraved,
Nicholas Upton, edition 1654, p. 63], and several
of those attached to the Baron's letter, 1301
(<cite>Monumenta Vetusta</cite>, vol. i). These gradually, as
the fourteenth century progresses, assume an
appearance on seals exactly corresponding with
our modern supporters. We have "S' Fratris
Thome Archer," 1325 (Nicholas Upton, p. 73),
supported by two lions rampant counter-regardant
(see No. 75); "Sigillum Petri de Veel," 1361 (on
the same page) supported by two helmets with
panaches, very similar to those of Edmund de
Arundel still earlier 1301, given on p. 23, and
Edmund Mortimer, 1372, engraved on p. 26; and
we have two griffins supporting the helmet in the
seal of Richard, Earl of Arundel, 1330-75, see p. 27.
In the next century, supporting animals appear on
many of the large and beautiful seals: two greyhounds
in that of John, Lord Clinton de Say, 1438
(see No. 54); two horses in that of John, Earl of
Arundel, 1415-21 (see <cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. ii,
p. 55); two heraldic antelopes support the crest
of Humfrey, Earl of Stafford and Perche, 1438
(<cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xxxviii, p. 273); and many others
might be quoted. It is quite impossible to say
when we may begin to call such decorative adjuncts
"supporters." Planché (<cite>Pursuivant</cite>, p. 177) says
that at the close of the fourteenth century, in one
instance, Richard II. (1377) used two white harts,
his favourite badge, as supporters; but that those
of Henry VI. (1422) are considered to begin the
Royal series. In France, one supporter is frequently
seen and is then called a "tenant." In
Scotland, where French influence is in many ways
visible, we frequently meet with seals where a
single tree, man, bird, fabulous beast, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
supports the shield of arms. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Menestrier [<cite>Origine
des Ornemens</cite>, p. 93] traces many of these grotesque
animals to the attendants at tournaments who
paraded in such disguises, carrying the shields and
weapons of the knights.</p>

<p>Supporters also occur in illuminations and
carvings, and not being then confined within the
narrow sphere of a seal, they stand much as in
modern drawings&mdash;see the arms of Edward IV.,
1460, in Willement's <cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>; also the
carving on the Founder's pew in North Witham
Church, co. Lincoln, being the arms and supporters
of Sir Thomas de la Laund, 1470 (<cite>Archæological
Journal</cite>, vol. ii, p. 87).</p>

<p>From the above remarks it will be seen that no
datings, at any rate in the earlier centuries, can be
deduced from the presence of supporters; indeed,
there are instances of stone carvings on dwellings,
in which it seems to me that the cutter, as in early
seals, has added supporters merely to beautify his
design and balance his shield, without any heraldic
intention or authority whatever. Heraldry was a
"mystery" as well as a science, and if the cutter
had placed supporters, when decorating the mansion
of a neighbouring lord, he might, in the same way,
balance his design on the house of some obscure
gentleman.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3 class="oldeng break">Mottoes.</h3>

<p>Called in French "Devises" or, when of ancient
origin, "Cri de guerre." Menestrier (<cite>Origine des
Ornemens</cite>) traces such to very ancient, even Roman,
times. These arose from various circumstances,
often accidental and frivolous, and as fresh mottoes
were frequently assumed by English families, it is
sometimes possible to establish an approximate date
by discovering when the accompanying motto was
adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="oldeng break">Helmets,</h3>



<p class="unindent">sometimes, on early seals and carvings, are
valuable as indications of date and examples of the
types then prevalent; but, in other and later
instances, they seem to be fancifully treated, and
so would not be reliable. They form too large a
subject for discussion here, and one that has been
most ably and exhaustively treated in works on
Armour.</p>

<hr class="tb"/>



<p>I now proceed to consider the <a href="#PLATE_I">shapes as sketched</a>,
taking the several numbers by the groups into
which they naturally fall. Many more instances
might have been quoted for the various shapes, but
I have selected these to show, so far as I have been
able to gather them, the extreme range of dates.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may venture here to remark that the
search for ancient shapes of shields, with a view to
their slavish reproduction, which is now so usual,
does not seem to have been so prevalent before
about the year 1840. This is the date which seems
generally accepted as that when originality in the
matter of seals and book-plates ceased, and every
variety of old examples began to be sedulously
searched out and copied.</p>

<p>All of these shields are subject to slight variations
of outline, according to the fancy of the artist and
their necessary adaptation to their surroundings.</p>

<p>No. 8 in the accompanying plate of shapes
appears in stained glass to the memory of Sir
Wm. Berdwell (will, dated 1434), Blomefield's
<cite>Norfolk</cite>, vol. i, p. 203.</p>

<p>An Irish instance, but of very ungraceful proportions,
date 1507, is engraved <cite>Archæological

of which are attached
as a counterseal to a lease

on the back rendered it
impossible to detach the

fraudulently to another document.

<p>These shapes lend themselves particularly to

such cases to give an exact date.</p>

<p>From all which it appears that these shapes&mdash;Nos.
13 to 15&mdash;began about 1520, and prevailed

from about 1610 to 1694.</p>

<p>The shape is used in Sir Peter
Leycester's <cite>Historical Antiquities of
Cheshire</cite>, published in 1673.</p>

<p>Again in Sylvanus Morgan's <cite>Sphere of Gentry</cite>,
published 1661.</p>

<p>No. 24 appears in stone carving at Penshurst
Place, Kent, showing the arms of Edward VI.,
1547. The side points are curled round, and the
centre one is capped with a fillet and half globe:
an improvement by the stone cutter (Willement's
<cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>), see No. 77.</p>

<p>It is found in the seals and in the crown-pieces
of the Commonwealth, dated 1650.</p>

<p>Taking then the Georgian No. 25&mdash;In Willement's
<cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>, the arms of Henrietta Maria, the
wife of Chas. I., 1625, are reproduced in this shape.</p>

<p>It becomes very frequent 1783-92, and up to 1806
in monuments and book-plates&mdash;see page 56.</p>

<p>The shield is used in a work published at
Worcester 1795, <cite>Historical Anecdotes of Heraldry
and Chivalry</cite>.</p>

<p>Very many of the bulky seals so common during
the last thirty years of the eighteenth century display
coats of arms on shields of this shape, which seems to
have been much used about this date. The Liverpool
halfpenny, 1791, see No. 78; the Leeds halfpenny,
1791; and the Cronebane halfpenny, 1789; and no
doubt many other copper tokens show No. 25.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 26 is figured by Randle Holme (<cite>Academy
of Armoury</cite>, 1688), who took it from Sylvanus
Morgan's <cite>Sphere of Gentry</cite>, 1661. He explains it
is from old and decayed monuments. It is really
adapted from ancient shields, which were used by
the Amazons, and they are constantly represented
with such shields and with double-headed battle
axes on Greek coins (see <cite>Petiti de Amazonibus
Dissertatio</cite>, 1687, p. 180, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>The only change noticeable in these shields is
that the Stuart, which extended down to certainly
as late as 1694, have perpendicular sides,&mdash;with
an occasional exception, as that quoted 1625,&mdash;while
in the Georgian the sides are always more or
less bulged out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nos. 27, 28, 29, and 30, with which may conveniently
be taken the tops, designated "eared couped."</p>

<p>No. 27&mdash;This shape occurs in Brussels tapestry,
dated 1610. The sides are more hollowed-out, and
the ears more projected (Jacquemart's <cite>History of
Furniture</cite>, p. 102, English translation).</p>

<p>Very frequently in ledger tombs, 1718, 1749,
1750, and in 1680 (see <cite>Miscell. Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>,
November, 1884, p. 172).</p>

<p>In a MS. dated 1710;</p>

<p>Also in the Radcliffe book-plate, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1720,
engraved in Mr. Rylands' <cite>Notes on Book-Plates</cite>,
1889, p. 30.</p>

<p>No. 28&mdash;The arms of Caroline of Brandenburg,
wife of George II., 1727, are given on this shield
in Willement's <cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>.</p>

<p>No. 29&mdash;Several of the engravings in Guillim's
<cite>Display</cite>, edition 1724, and in <cite>The English Baronetage</cite>,
1741, partake of this character, thus giving a range
from 1610 to 1741 for this group.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No. 31 is a shield very extensively used in
Germany and Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>It first appears in the seals of the Counts of
Flanders (Oliver Vredius) in 1477 and 1487, and
disappears in 1602.</p>

<p>It is figured fo. 1<i>b</i> in the <cite>Nuremberg Chronicle</cite>,
published 1493.</p>

<p>It may be constantly found at all dates, and down
to the present day in German heraldry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<p>Nos. 32, 33, and 34.</p>

<p>No. 32&mdash;This shield has a very extensive range
of date; the first I have noticed is on the tomb
of Anne of Cleves, in Westminster Abbey, 1539
(engraved in Willement's <cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>).</p>

<p>Engravings in an illustrated edition of Ariosto,
printed Venetia, 1572, repeat the same shape.</p>

<p>In Bolton's <cite>Elements of Armories</cite>, 1610, where
such arms as those of Paracoussi, King of Plate,
The Navatalcas, early Mexicans, and the Incas of
Peru, are placed in such shields.</p>

<p>The sixpences and York half-crowns of Charles I.,
1614, and the arms on his Great Seal, 1627 (Sandford's
<cite>Genealogical History</cite>, p. 515).</p>

<p>In a MS., 1652, reproduced in <cite>Miscell. Genealogica</cite>
for January, 1885, p. 204.</p>

<p>The Great Seal of Charles II., 1653 (Sandford's
<cite>Genealogical History</cite>, p. 517).</p>

<p>The seals of the Commonwealth in 1651 and 1656.</p>

<p>Engravings in Bisse's edition of Nicholas Upton,
published 1654;</p>

<p>Also in Sandford's <cite>Genealogical History</cite>, 1677.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
seals with this shape are common enough, many of
most beautiful execution, supported by cornucopiæ,
fruit and flowers issuant therefrom; these extend
from 1670 to 1700. We need only look at our
Britannia's shield in a modern penny to see the
same, adapted from that coin of Antoninus Pius
where occurs the first representation of the figure
of Britannia, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 138.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 33.&mdash;The earliest I have noted is on the
seal of Sir Thomas de Bikenore, Knt., attached to
a charter, <i>s.d.</i>, but about 1300; this is engraved
<cite>Archæolog. Cantiana</cite>, vol. ii, p. 41.</p>

<p>It occurs upon the seals of the Counts of
Flanders from 1403 to 1623 (Oliver Vredius); it
also appears elsewhere in his work.</p>

<p>It is also on the tomb in Maidstone Church to
John Wotton, 1417 (<cite>Arch. Cantiana</cite>, vol. i, p. 181).</p>

<p>It may be seen in the printer's mark of Richard
Pynson, 1530.</p>

<p>I have also noticed No. 33 in one of Camden's
grants, dated 2nd May, 1608, to James Master of
East Landen, Kent: this is engraved <cite>Archæologia
Cantiana</cite>, vol. v, p. 238.</p>

<p>No. 34 is, I think, chiefly restricted to foreign
seals and engravings. I have not, so far, noticed
an English example.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<p>Nos. 35, 42, and 43.</p>

<p>No. 35&mdash;Egg-shaped may be regarded very much
as a variation of No. 32, some artists considering it
more graceful and better adapted to hold the arms
and leave less of the field vacant. The shield of
Edward the Black Prince, preserved at Canterbury,
and already noticed at p. 30, was of this shape.
He died 1376 (Bolton's <cite>Elements</cite>, p. 67).</p>

<p>But there is a large number of such seals as may
be described egg-shaped, with hollowed-out sides,
and frequently framed in scrolls; these are classed
as cardioid Nos. 42 and 43, the outlines having
been altered by scroll work, although sometimes
the scrolls are omitted.</p>

<p>These occur in <cite>Divi Britannici</cite>, by Sir Winston
Churchill, 1675;</p>

<p>In monuments of 1684, &amp;c., in Blomefield's
<cite>Norfolk</cite>;</p>

<p>And of 1699, <cite>Miscell. Genealogica et Heraldica</cite> for
December, 1884, p. 185;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Again in 1715, <cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. ii,
p. 230; and they are constantly to be found in
monumental tablets.</p>

<p>Very frequently the bases of shields with hollowed-out
sides are turned either to dexter or
sinister, as noticed in seals throughout the eighteenth
century; and in some later Jacobean, and
in Chippendale book-plates say from 1720 to nearly
the end of the century.</p>

<p>No. 36&mdash;French shields, so constantly represented
in French heraldry, appear also in English grants
of arms, 1557, 1561, 1582, 1612.</p>

<p>This is just an ordinary square shield, No. 7,
with a pointed French base.</p>

<p>This shield, however, may be found at much
earlier dates&mdash;see remarks on Simon de Montacute's
seal to the Baron's letter, 1301, on p. 22; also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
very curious brass formerly in St. Nicholas' Church,
Lynn, to Thomas Waterdeyn, Mayor of Lynn in
1397 and 1404. This shows two shields, No. 36,
which bear his merchant's mark, and stand on
either side of a tree. He was alive in 1410 (see
engraving, <cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. xxxix, p. 505).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No. 39.&mdash;This curious Italian shield occurs in
Gerard Leigh's <cite>Accedens of Armoury</cite>, 1562.</p>

<p>Also with curious scroll-work, dated 1589, in a
timber house at Norwich, engraved, <cite>Archæologia</cite>,
vol. xvi, p. 194.</p>

<p>In the Great Seal of Charles I., 1640, Sandford's
<cite>Genealogical History</cite>, p. 516.</p>

<p>In the halfpenny of Charles II., 1660.</p>

<p>In the halfpenny of James II., 1685.</p>

<p>Randle Holme, book i, p. 6, would have us
believe this was "the veritable shape of the Christal
shield given by the goddess Minerva to Perseus,
to enable him to slay the Gorgon Medusa, and
which was after dedicated to Pallas," and this
conceit may account for a monster's head introduced
in the Great Seal of Charles I., 1640.</p>

<p>Grotesque shields, somewhat of this shape, are
given to Ancient Britons, as in Speed's <cite>Theatre of
Great Britain</cite>, 1676, and in MS. pedigrees of early
seventeenth century, for the arms of Welsh princes
and early potentates. Randle Holme (<cite>Academy of
Armoury</cite>) gives one of these as from the monument
of Mahomet, Emperor of Turkey, and another from
the monument of Tamerlane, Emperor of Tartaria.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nos. 40 and 41 actually do occur frequently in
Roman bronzes and monuments, and are reproduced
in engravings in Bolton's <cite>Elements of Armories</cite>,
1610, p. 147, &amp;c. Bolton explains that it (41) occurs
on the Column to Antoninus at Rome, but later
discoveries have shown that this column was really
erected to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus in 174 <span class="smcap">A.D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></span></p>

<p>Nos. 42 and 43 cardioid shields (see the remarks
upon 33, 34 and 35).&mdash;I think these arose from the
decorative scroll-work
placed
around egg-shaped
shields,
and especially in
late Jacobean
and Chippendale
times, when they
may be found in
monuments and
book-plates. The
earliest mural
tablet I have
noticed is dated
1699, at Winchester
Cathedral.
This is engraved
<cite>Miscellanea Genealogica
et Heraldica</cite> for December, 1884, p. 185.</p>

<p>The engravings in <cite>Divi Britannici</cite>, noticed under
the variations of 35, nearly approach these.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<div class="figright">

<p>Instances of pure heart-shaped shields occur in
the brass to Willem Wenemaer, slain 1325. This
is in the vestibule to the
hospital which he founded at
Ghent (<cite>Archæological Journal</cite>,
vol. vii, p. 287);</p>

<p>Also in a monument at
St. Margaret's, Hertford,
1691-2, shown in the annexed
illustration. This is from
<cite>Miscell. Geneal. et Heraldica</cite>,
January, 1887, p. 197; and
the shape may also be found
at later dates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>My readers will also refer to that very interesting
seal of Richard Basset, about 1145, described at
p. 13, and No. 44: it is heart-shaped, greatly
lengthened out.</p>

<p>A very curious heart-shaped shield, with the point
turned round and scrolled, appears in the wooden
effigy to one of the family of Oglander in Brading
Church, Isle of Wight. This is supposed to be of
sixteenth century. It is engraved in the Anastatic
Drawing Society's vol. for 1883.</p>

<p>A curious instance of the recrudescence of early
forms occurs when Sylvanus Morgan, vol. i, p. 27,
places the arms of one Gill in a triangular shield,
such as we noticed in the thirteenth century, and
figured No. 1 in the sheet.</p>

<p>Again, heater-pear shields, No. 6, frequently
occur in early monuments, as they accorded well
with the style of decoration&mdash;see the monument to
Henry Willoughby, 1581, at Wollaton (Thoroton's
<cite>Notts</cite>, p. 27); also that to Richard Mansfield, 1624,
at West Lake Church (Thoroton, p. 27); also that
to Thomas Atkinson, 1661, at Newark-on-Trent
(Thoroton, p. 200); also in a monument to the
Clifton family, about 1670, engraved p. 61 in the
same book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<p>It would be possible to give much more fully the
exacter history of several of these shields, showing
their various slight variations prevailing at different
dates, but such would extend my "attempt" beyond
a convenient length.</p>

<p>I have, however, selected one of the most
common occurrence, feeling sure that its history will
therefore be the more interesting. In <cite>A Glossary
of Terms used in British Heraldry</cite>, published by
Parker, Oxford, 1847, the date 1724 is given as the
"earliest shield that has been noticed of this
tasteless, though still prevalent form," No. 81.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, here is the exact sequence with the small
variations which I have been able to trace:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq">

<p class="ia3">No. 79&mdash;Occurs in a book printed by W. Rastell
in 1533, quoted in Parker's <cite>Glossary</cite>.</p>

<p class="ia2">In an inlaid chimney-piece at Bolsover Castle,
with the arms Cavendish impaling Ogle, and
therefore the date is 1590-1600.</p>

<p class="ia2">Also in a MS. pedigree of Howard, date 1580,
in the possession of Col. Crosse at Shaw
Hill, co. Lancaster.</p>

<p class="ia2">The next instance I have found is carved on
a pew in Warrington Church, and bears
the inscription "Richard Massye, 1617."
This shows arms quarterly, (1) Rixton of
Rixton, (2) Mascy of Rixton, (3) Warburton
(?), see Historic Society of Lancashire and
Cheshire vol. xxxix, p. 154, where this quartering
is discussed; (4) Horton of Horton.</p>

<p class="ia2">The same shaped shield appears in a monument
to Richard Wiatt, who died in 1619.
This stands in Isleworth Church, and is
engraved in <cite>Herald and Gen.</cite>, vol. iii, p. 500.</p>

<p class="ia3">No. 84&mdash;Is frequently found in MSS. about 1620.
I can refer to the pedigree of the Holland and
Dukenfield families, which is dated 1622.</p>

<p class="ia2">The same shield is used in Bysse's edition
of Nicholas Upton, which was published in
1654.</p>

<p class="ia2">Also in a certificate of arms by Segar Garter,
1625, Historic Society of Lancashire and
Cheshire, vol. xxxviii, p. 72.</p>

<p class="ia2">It is also carved in oak in Prescot Church, with
the arms of Ogle of Whiston quartering
Bertram, and the date 1650.</p>

<p class="ia2">It again occurs on the gravestone of Richard
Clegg, Vicar of Kirkham; the earliest date
on which is 1677 (Chetham Society, vol. xcii,
p. 128).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p class="ia2">The same, but more slightly eared, occurs
frequently with the dedicatory arms of the
donors of the plates to Sandford's <cite>Genealogical
History</cite>, published 1677.</p>

<p class="ia2">A ledger stone, dated 1690, with the ears still
less strongly marked, is engraved <cite>Miscell.
Genealog.</cite> for February, 1885, p. 242.</p>

<p class="ia3">No. 82&mdash;Occurs in a grant of arms, dated 1684,
<cite>Miscell. Genealogica</cite>, second series, vol. i,
p. 397.</p>

<p class="ia2">The same shield appears in a grant, dated
1696, printed in the same work, first series,
vol. ii, p. 191.</p>

<p class="ia2">Such shields with very slightly marked ears,
and with pointed or angular, also with
French bases, are found very frequently in
book-plates of 1700 and for ten years or so
later, and sometimes with the sides very
slightly hollowed-out.</p>

<p class="ia3">No. 83&mdash;Is a shield with Queen Anne's arms, 1706,
engraved in Willement's <cite>Regal Heraldry</cite>.</p>

<p class="ia3">No. 80&mdash;May be seen in the monument to Tho.
Norreys, 1624, in Rainham Church, Kent
(<cite>Archæologia Cantiana</cite>, vol. vi, p. 295).</p>

<p class="ia2">A grant of arms, dated 1720, is engraved in
<cite>Miscell. Genealogica</cite>, vol. ii, p. 252, and shews
the same shield.</p>

<p class="ia2">Seals about the year 1718 appear with this
same shape, of rather broad proportions,
and with French bases rather flattened.</p>

<p class="ia3">No. 81&mdash;In Wright's edition of Peter Heylin's <cite>Helps
to History</cite>, published 1773, this variation is
used, but of rather longer proportions.</p>

<p class="ia2">About 1780, seals are noticed to follow the
same character, and with angular or French
bases, just as we see them prevailing even
to the present day.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
	<p class="plate">Plate VI.</p>
	<a href="images/i_091_big.jpg">
	<img id="PLATE_VI" src="images/i_091.jpg" width="352" height="600" alt="Plate VI" />
	</a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>This shield therefore, with slight variations in
the ears, may be found from 1533 to the present
day; and the date given in Parker's <cite>Glossary</cite> was
fixed upon insufficient research.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>


<h3 class="oldeng break">Counterseals</h3>

<p class="unindent">in England are usually of the same shape and size
as the seal proper; the pendant cake of wax thus
showing two complete impressions, one on each side.</p>

<p>Edward the Confessor and his successors have
continuously used them; but among subjects they
do not appear before 1130&mdash;excepting, perhaps, that
remarkable instance of two seals conjoined back to
back on the charter of Odo, Bishop of Baieux in
1075. See <cite>Archæologia</cite>, vol. i, p. 335.</p>

<p>Nobility of the blood royal, their wives and
daughters, seem to have used counterseals pretty
generally from the middle of the twelfth century.
The greater titular nobility also adopted them
occasionally during that century; but in the next,
and until the Baron's letter (1301), a much larger
number occur. Their use, however, was very
irregular: many prominent titular nobles neglected
them, and, on the other hand, we find many families
of only moderate territorial position placing secreta
on the back of charter seals. I notice as quite
remarkable how many ladies who had come to represent
a manor, about the middle of the thirteenth
century, when the fashion was at its height, at once
beautified or safeguarded their seals with a secretum.</p>

<p>After 1301 such extra sealing almost disappears,
but there are some very late instances. Humfrey
Earl of Stafford and Perche, 1438, placed on the
back of his splendid seal a smaller one&mdash;the Stafford
arms on a heater shield, within a decoration of three
Stafford knots, but without any inscription (<cite>Archæologia</cite>,
vol. xxxviii); and some of those large and
pretentious seals mentioned as appearing 1450-1475
were used with small counterseals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Many ecclesiastical communities used counterseals,
also the old Cinque ports and other ancient
boroughs. Ancient official departments too, such
as the Norwich Staple, 1272-1307: these having
begun, of course continued their use as an established
form.</p>

<div class="chapter"> </div>

<h3 class="oldeng break">Secreta</h3>

<p class="unindent">were usually small, and inscribed "Secretum."
The first I have noticed is that of Seherus de
Quenci, created Earl in 1210&mdash;"Secretum Comitis
Wintonie." (Spelman's <cite>Aspilogia</cite>, p. 67.) John de
Busli, however, is even a little earlier; "Secretum
Johannis de Bueli" (<cite>The Earls of Eu</cite>, by Chester
Waters, p. 33).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a careful examination I have come to the
conclusion that no regulations restricted their use,
but counterseals and secreta were adopted or not,
according to taste. Some regarded them as an
accession of dignity, and some as a safeguard:
there seems no doubt it was for the second reason
that that signet was placed, in 1529, on the back of
the Dartford Priory Seal (see p. 60); and I find
another instance, where a seal of the same Priory,
in 1534, had as a counterseal the impression of a
small signet with the letters <span class="smcap">I F</span>, being apparently
the initials of Isabel or Joan Fane, the prioress at
that time.</p>

<p class="breakaft">It will give some idea as to the prevalence of
counterseals if I say that to the Baron's letter,
1301, are appended ninety-five seals of the principal
nobility. Seventy-nine have no counterseals: to
sixteen such are attached; namely, eight of the
same size as the seals, and eight greatly smaller.
Two of these smaller ones are not inscribed (William
de Brehouse and Simon de Montacute), and
one only is called "Secretum" (Walteri de Teye).
I think this shows they were less commonly used
in 1301 than about 1250.</p>

<h3 class="oldeng break">Mantlings from the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century.</h3>



<p class="nobreak">It is somewhat difficult to treat distinctly of the
mantlings prevailing since the beginning of the
sixteenth century; but as they afford indirect
evidence of date, I venture to draw up the following
short description of their variations; and I do
so with some diffidence, in the hope that fellow-students
may add to my feeble effort, and that thus
we may presently arrive at a perfect and dated
scheme of these changes.</p>

<p>I am obliged to treat seals separately from
drawings and stone carvings, because the circumscribed
space in a seal seems to have prevented
some of the variations noticed in the others. At
the same time, several characteristic changes are
found to occur, and at tolerably distinct dates;
and so it is possible to lay down very clearly, as to
seals, the current of progressive change.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By far the greater number of heraldic <span class="smcap">Seals</span> at
the beginning of the sixteenth century have no
mantling, but display only a bare shield, without
ornament&mdash;unless some scroll-work or architectural
lines, to fill up the space within the dotted or plain
circles. Such seals occur constantly till the end of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>About 1550 helmets with mantlings, open and
rather sparse, and kept high up on the top of the
shield, appear. These mantlings are rather flat,
so that a good space is left for the crest, which
thus stands out distinctly. As a specimen, see
Wm. Lambarde's seal, 1552 (<cite>Archæologia Cantiana</cite>,
vol. v, p. 256).</p>

<p>Although a good many seals continue still with
the mantlings kept up about the top of the shield
(while sometimes a motto, &amp;c., is introduced below),
it is observed that a little after this date mantlings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
gradually creep downwards, perhaps to two-thirds
of the depth of the shield. See a seal of the
Throckmorton family, 1576 (<cite>Visitation of Warwick,
1619</cite>, Harl. Soc.); also those of Lord Chancellor
Bromley, 1581 (<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. v, p. 5);
John Ogle, 1597 (Mascy Charters, plate C, Historic
Society of Lancashire and Cheshire for 1887); and
Edward Osborne, 1618 (<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>,
vol. iv, p. 241; also <cite>Archæologia Cantiana</cite>, vol. v,
p. 234).</p>

<p>This is the character of many examples occurring
down to about the year 1650, when a greater profusion
of mantling began to be shown: of this the
seal of Sir Edward Nicholas, engraved on p. 45, is
a good example; and it is the first instance I have
noticed in which the folds of the mantling come out
<em>from behind</em> the shield, thus marring its distinctness.
Usually, although the volume of foldings increases,
they are kept away from it, so as to leave the
impression of the shield standing out and quite
clear. In this, too, the folds extend higher up on
either side of the crest than is usual in earlier
examples.</p>

<p>It may be interesting here to note that of the
fifty-nine seals attached to the death warrant of
Charles I., in 1648-9&mdash;following the very accurate
engraving in <cite>Monumenta Vetusta</cite>, vol. ii,&mdash;twenty-one
show mantlings, eleven are distinctly without, ten
are doubtful, and the remaining seventeen seals
are quite illegible.</p>

<p>From about 1650 many beautifully cut signets
are found&mdash;the arms, with helmets, crests, and
mantlings, the points of which rise up on either
side of the crest, thus filling up that empty space.
The seal of the Cordwainers of Oxford, made in
1680, is a favourable example of the date (<cite>Arch.
Journal</cite>, vol. vi, pp. 159 and 279).</p>

<p>About 1680 I have observed tassels sometimes
appear as a finish to the lower ends of mantlings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as in the seal of Thomas Bate, engraved on p. 45;
also in a signet of 1683, in <cite>Miscellanea Genealogica
et Heraldica</cite> for 1886, p. 143; and elsewhere.</p>


<p>Shields set in frames of scroll-work, without
mantlings, were prevalent from the beginning of
the seventeenth century. For an example, see a
signet of Fetherston, 1638, engraved in the <cite>Visitation
of Warwick</cite> (Harleian Society).</p>

<p>From about 1670 cornucopiæ, with flowers, &amp;c.,
appear, supporting shields more or less egg-shaped;
and some of them are most exquisitely engraved.
But even at so late a date, I have not observed
tincture lines introduced.</p>

<p>I have noticed very few seals about this time in
the Jacobean taste. Probably no room was left in
so confined a space for scroll-work around the
base of the shield. But mantlings&mdash;rather heavy,
although not voluminous, and kept up pretty high&mdash;are
found towards the end of this seventeenth
century. In many cases also, at this time, plain
Georgian shields occur, without mantling.</p>

<p>Early in the eighteenth century seals are found
in late Jacobean frames, open and with trellis-work,
adorned with rushes and flowers, and without
mantlings.</p>

<p>The influence of Chippendale taste strongly
affected seals from about 1750 to 1775.</p>

<p>Many followed in the style of Adam, with ribbons
and festoons of flowers, and sometimes lightly
scrolled frames. These, of course, are without
mantlings.</p>

<p>We are thus brought to the end of the eighteenth
century. Only occasionally have I met with mantlings
between about 1740 and 1800; but I must
explain that it is very difficult to get together a
body of examples of the eighteenth century: such
are not old enough to be figured in engravings,
and documents likely to bear them are not of
sufficient interest to be examined for any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
purpose. I trust fellow-students who read this
book will sketch, with their dates, all instances of
this epoch: it is only in that way we can get
together a body of evidence.</p>

<p>It seems to have been very common, also, for
successive generations to repeat the style of their
seals, as if that were as important as the heraldry
displayed; and thus instances of the several
variations occur, perhaps, much later than their
legitimate dates&mdash;as classified above, from many
examples. I know one family whose seals from
1718 to 1840 show, with only one or two exceptions,
"the tasteless though still prevalent form" No. 80,
and without any mantlings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<p>Although taking <span class="smcap">Drawings</span> and <span class="smcap">Stone Carvings</span>
together, there are certain differences observable in
each; for instance, we constantly find, in monumental
sculptures of the sixteenth century, designs
with mantlings above and scroll-work below, which
very closely correspond with Jacobean book-plates
and engravings such as did not appear till about
1720. I would refer to Thoroton's <cite>History of Notts</cite>,
p. 227; where is engraved a monument, at Wollaton,
to Henry Willoughby, who died 1581, which is quite
Jacobean in taste and treatment. Another equally
so is at Newark-upon-Trent Church: this was
erected in 1661, to Thomas Atkinson (Thoroton's
<cite>Notts</cite>, p. 200). Another with cornucopiæ and
scrolls stands in West Lake Church, to the memory
of Richard Mansfield, who died 1624 (Thoroton's
<cite>Notts</cite>, p. 27). This last exactly corresponds with
some of Hollar's beautiful designs, in Sandford's
<cite>Genealogical History</cite>, published in 1677; and it is
very remarkable that these are a distinct <em>advance
upon</em> Hollar's own designs in the preface and
dedication to the Bysse edition of Nicholas Upton,
which he engraved in 1654; while for nearly fifty
years this monumental example had stood in West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Lake Church, and we know it was only one of
many similar English works. I have many times
noticed that sculpture precedes engravings or
paintings. It is, I think, inherently so: designing
in the round comes first, to be afterwards translated,
by skilful and artistic and educated shading, into
the flat.</p>

<div class="figright">
	<img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="300" height="341" alt="seal" />
</div>

<p>Through the kindness of Dr. Jackson Howard,
Maltravers Herald, and Messrs. Mitchell and
Hughes, I am able to shew the engraving (from
<cite>Miscell. Genealogica et Heraldica</cite> for 1884, p. 99)
of a very unusual
mantling from the
Confirmation of
Arms in 1526, by
Thomas Hawley,
Clarenceux, to
Francoys Galuerdet,
a native of
Rhodes, and Receiver
General in
England for the
Hospital of St.
John of Jerusalem.
This mantling
is unusually
small; there is no
helmet, and the
torce is beautifully
worked [compare the brass to Sir Wm. Say,
lithograph No. 71]. I put this forward first because
of its early date, and it seems that at this time
mantlings in heraldic drawings, grants, &amp;c., were
kept very small.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to describe, and in a
numbered list as follows, the variations observed
at successive dates.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;From 1550 to 1570 there is a tendency to
keep the greater portion of mantlings above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
shield. They are of smaller volume, and one fold
is allowed to wander down on each side, ending in
a tassel about one-third down the depth of the
shield. A very characteristic example is engraved
in <cite>Miscell. Genealogica et Heraldica</cite> for June, 1887,
being the grant to Thomas ffletewood, of London,
1st June, 1545. In the grant to John Lambard,
15th January, 1551 (engraved in <cite>Archæologia
Cantiana</cite>, vol. v, p. 247), such a mantling has four
tassels, two above carried up somewhat high, and
two below standing about one-third down the
shield. The mantling to the arms of Goodricke,
engraved in Gerard Legh's <cite>Accedens of Armory</cite>,
edition 1562, is of the same character, but without
tassels.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;A little later the number of folds is observed
to increase, and the tassels are carried down further
and turn inwards towards the base point of the
shield.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;In a grant dated 1572, which is printed in
<cite>Miscell. Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>, vol. i, p. 321,
occurs the first instance I have noticed of the
foldings coming from behind the shield, and the
same may be seen in a grant of 1575, printed in
Sylvanus Morgan's <cite>Sphere of Gentry</cite>, lib. ii, p. 74.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;From about 1590 to 1630 a return to the
simpler style is observable; a single fold wandering
away from the body and reaching with tassels to
the base of the shield. Occasional instances return
wholly to the descriptions given under 1 and 2.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;After about 1620 the volume of mantling
gradually increased, and seemed to be purposely so
arranged as to come out from behind, probably
because it was found in drawings to give artistic
relief to the shield.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;By about the year 1670 mantlings are frequently
found of excessive volume, and in a mass,
which would be solid were it not skilfully broken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
lighter hackings appearing in the central portions;
the folds come down in heavy masses, sometimes
like great sausages or cucumbers, to the bottom of
the shield. Examples of such may be seen in
Sandford's <cite>Genealogical History</cite>, 1677, and in book-plates
engraved in <cite>Miscell. Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>,
December, 1886, p. 184, and elsewhere. The skill
of the artist affects wonderfully the quality of these
designs; it is not only the chiaro-oscuro, but the
turning of a line may often sparkle with genius.
Sometimes they are extremely flat and heavy, for
instance, in the map attached to Thoroton's <cite>Notts</cite>,
1677, may be seen a specimen, which is a great
contrast to Hollar's designs in Sandford's <cite>Genealogical
History</cite>, published in the same year. Again, the
frontispiece to Carter's <cite>Honor Redivivus</cite>, published
in 1673, shows flat waves, and behind the shield,
coming out two-thirds down its length, the edges
rippling into leaves and hackings, while the folds
extend down to a boldly hacked and curled cartouche
for the motto, out of which spring two branches of
olive.</p>

<p>Instances of this style continue to occur down to
1750. We find them so engraved in Guillim's
<cite>Display</cite>, 1724, also in the <cite>English Baronetage</cite>, 1741,
and in some of the engravings in Atkyn's <cite>Gloucestershire</cite>,
1768.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;About the year 1700 appeared for a few
years, perhaps we may say till about 1720, book-plates
and dedicatory arms with great hacked
foldings twisted round and looking something like
Catherine-wheel fireworks. Two or four of these
occur in book-plates, and sometimes as many as
six, three on each side. We notice that these are
conventional exaggerations of the less pronounced
circular foldings and turnings seen so early as
1677 in some of Hollar's engravings in Sandford's
<cite>Genealogical History</cite>. An engraving at p. 185 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Chauncey's <cite>History of Hertford</cite>, published in 1700,
is especially interesting; it shows a monument,
dated 1662, to Hewytt, in Sawbridgeworth Church,
where the carver has struggled to avoid the long
ugly folds ("cucumbers"), and has introduced very
vigorously twisted leaves and hacks which almost
approach those conventional Catherine-wheel fireworks
as found in book-plates of a later date, say
from 1700 to 1720. I would point out that all the
armorial engravings in Chauncey's <cite>Herts</cite> are well
worth studying: the mantlings are hacked all over,
and extend about four-fifths down the shields in
endless small and vigorous twists, the shields themselves
being variations of No. 16. Some of the
engravings in Plot's <cite>Natural History of Oxfordshire</cite>,
published in 1705, show the same character, also
some of those in Atkyn's <cite>History of Gloucestershire</cite>,
published in 1768.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;The rebound from this taste led to small
mantlings, kept a good deal at the top of the shield,
even although there were no supporters, as in a
peer's coat of arms, to prevent their downward
flow. These occur also when the bases of the
shields in Jacobean book-plates are finished off
with scroll work, trellis, scales, &amp;c., &amp;c.; the upper
part of the shield being ornamented with such
smallish mantlings. In Blomefield's <cite>Norfolk</cite>, 1739,
ribbon scrolls extend all round some of the shields
in the place of a mantling; while in what is, I
suppose, a book-plate, Holland impaling Upton,
printed in the pedigrees at the beginning of vol. i,
acanthus leaves occur in the base, and break out
occasionally, where convenient, from such scrolls,
which are arranged round the upper part of the
shield. Scrolls are strictly architectural ornaments,
and not <em>vegetables</em>. These correspond to the
French style called "Bombé," in which curves and
undulations of surface in ribbons, &amp;c., were rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and tossed about for artistic effect. But with our
English examples of monuments of the sixteenth
century in the same taste (see p. 80), we need not
consider that our Jacobean style was borrowed
from the French, although that nation, for a full
century, ending in 1790, guided the artistic tastes
of Europe.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;During the Chippendale fashion all martial
elements disappear, helmets and mantlings are
swept away, and we see the style of Louis XV.
borrowed from the prevailing French taste, broken
shell-shaped woodwork, rocks, and shell curves
(rocaille coquille), hence called "Rococo." It was
well enough in the frames of mirrors and furniture,
but seems strangely out of place around a cardioid
shield of arms, with festoons of flowers and spikes
of reeds or grass, while perhaps Cupids or Greek
vases on brackets are introduced. Nevertheless,
the genius of Chippendale sublimated this into
specimens of great beauty. Chippendale's <cite>Books
of Designs</cite> were published in 1759, i vol., folio, and
in 1762, i vol., folio.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;Mantlings, of course, continued to be shown
in grants of arms. We find about 1775 they
appear to be smaller again, and confined to the top
of the shield, often being carried rather high up on
each side of the crest, and frequently ending at the
base in two tassels [see a grant 1779, <cite>Miscell.
Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>, second series, vol. iii,
p. 41].</p>

<p>11.&mdash;This style continued to the beginning of the
nineteenth century, when I have observed very
light and graceful mantlings thrown about in airy
and much hacked foldings, and generally ending in
tassels (see a grant 1803, <cite>Miscell. Genealogica et
Heraldica</cite>, original series, vol. ii, p. 20). This
character is also seen in many book-plates of this
date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>12.&mdash;I must now say a few words on the style
introduced and skilfully enforced by Robert and
James Adam. They, too, adopted from the French,
and by their skill and artistic taste developed to
great perfection the style of Louis XVI. (1774-90).
The rage for this fashion arose in Europe upon the
discovery at Pompeii of Roman frescoes preserved
in their original colours. The brothers Adam
caught the exact spirit of these, and produced
heraldic designs, consisting of shell-fluted scrolls,
with light and airy festoons of flowers and ribbons,
surrounding shields almost invariably Georgian
No. 25. The festoons were frequently extended in
graceful curves, from pegs, just as we see them in
the recovered Roman arabesques, or on the walls
of the Petit Trianon. Robert and James Adam
published their book in three vols., imp. folio,
1773-1822. For examples of this style see Dugdale's
<cite>Warwickshire</cite>, 1765; Hutchin's <cite>Dorset</cite>, 1774;
Hasted's <cite>Kent</cite>, 1778; Rudder's <cite>Gloucestershire</cite>, 1779
(one specimen only); Nichol's <cite>Leicestershire</cite>, 1795;
Shaw's <cite>Staffordshire</cite>, 1798; Manning and Bray's
<cite>Surrey</cite>, 1804. This long list will show how
extremely popular the Adam style continued to be
for about thirty years.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;As early as 1500, a fan-shaped mantling
with rounded base appears; it was formed of an
unhacked cloth with many closely folded rays, and
occasionally two tassels are attached to the <em>upper</em>
corners and hang down as supports on each side
of the shield, which stands in the middle&mdash;see
examples engraved in <cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol.
viii, p. 247; <cite>Archæologia Cantiana</cite>, vol. v, p. 248;
<cite>Miscell. Genealogica et Heraldica</cite>, first series, vol. ii,
p. 100; &amp;c., &amp;c. This design is continued until
after 1700, but seems less closely folded at the later
dates, when they are often found in ornamental
achievements in pedigrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>14.&mdash;A curious example of a mantling is engraved
<cite>Herald and Genealogist</cite>, vol. viii, p. 254, in which
a square sheet or cloth, having no hacking, and
attached to the helmet, is folded-in round the
edges; through these a cord is passed, ending in
two tassels which extend a little below the bottom
of the mantle. This portion of the cloth, as well
as the back, hangs down straight without any folds.
The result is that the shield stands out against the
deeply shaded back ground within these folded-in
edges, they being in high light. The MS. from
which this is taken is dated 1645, and the shield
displays the arms of Helsby.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;The earliest instance I have noticed of
those large unhacked square sheets or mantles
called by Porney "drapery," which are drawn up
through two rings or ribbons at the upper corners
and fall in folds, while in the middle stands the
shield of arms, occurs in a monument at Holme
Pierpoint to the Countess of Kingston, which bears
date 1649 (Thoroton's <cite>Notts</cite>, p. 90). Such are also
engraved in the <cite>Sphere of Gentry</cite>, 1661; and in the
<cite>English Baronetage</cite>, 1741. These are occasionally
to be met with down to 1840. In French heraldry
they are commonly found.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In <cite>Archæologia Cantiana</cite>, vol. x, p. 329, is engraved
a curious tent-shaped "drapery," drawn
over the helm and held there by a ducal coronet,
from which starts the crest, while beneath, and in
the middle of the sheet, stand the shield of arms
and supporters. This is from "The Confirmation
of Supporters, Crest and Arms to Sir Edward
Dering, Knt. and Bart., by Sir Wm. Segar,
Garter." The first baronet was created 1st Feb.,
1626, and Sir Wm. Segar died in 1633; so the
date of this drawing is within those seven years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It must be evident that each artist gave a certain
character and style of his own to his work; at the
same time the various fashions noted above are
found strongly prevailing at the dates given. They
were what was approved by the public taste, and
any variations only extend to more or less skilful
working out. It will be noticed that public taste
has several times alternated between sparse and
voluminous mantlings. There are indications at
the present time which seem to point to a return,
within a few years, of the massive convolutions
seen during the last quarter of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<p>In ledger stones and monuments from 1650 the
characteristics given above are followed until about
1780, when other kinds of decoration&mdash;palm
branches, festoons, and scrolls&mdash;very largely superseded
mantlings.</p>

<h3 class="break">IMPORTANT NOTE ON TINCTURE-LINES IN SEALS.</h3>

<p>My readers would notice at page 52 and again
at page 79 that I could not accept the statements
that seals so early as 1648-9 could possibly show
tincture-lines. I therefore gave my authorities,
and showed pretty evidently that I could not, in the
face of other <em>facts</em>, accept them. Since the writing
of those pages, Mr. W. H. St. John Hope has very
kindly examined for me the original document
preserved among the muniments at the House of
Lords, and reports that in <em>none</em> of the seals attached
to the death-warrant of Charles I. are the tinctures
indicated by lines. It is not for me to explain how
so accurate an observer as the late Mr. Planché
made such a mistake. I think it is probable that
the late Mr. Bouttell followed him and enlarged
somewhat. The fact, however, is now definitively
settled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>I had observed that in those earlier printed books
which have copper plates, the invention of Father
Silvester de Petra Sancta had been very cautiously
and undecidedly adopted. In Spelman's <cite>Aspilogia</cite>
[included in that small folio published by Edward
Bysse in 1654, and to which I have frequently
referred as containing also the works of Nicholas
Upton and John de Bado Aureo] most of the
shields have tincture lines; but in some of the
copper plates, signs of various planets are given
instead of those letters for tinctures which are
usually seen in "tricks."</p>


<h3 class="break">NOTE TO PAGE 36.</h3>

<p>I have no doubt that the curious projecting
point to which the attention of the reader has
been drawn, was meant as a protection against the
"Coup de jarret," that terrible feat of arms which
aimed at severing the muscles behind the knee,
a spot necessarily covered by leather only, and
therefore peculiarly vulnerable.</p>

Being deeply impressed with the
great value of a "<span class="smcap">Corpus Sigillorum</span>"
which would bring together in
one view a large number of English
Seals of each century for the eye to
rest upon and so to comprehend the
varying styles at different dates, Mr.
Grazebrook puts forward the following
proposal to see if a sufficient number
of Subscribers will be found to support him, and meet
the heavy expense of producing such a work. It is
obvious that to lessen the number of illustrations would
impair its usefulness, and Mr. Grazebrook would not
undertake the book unless it can be thoroughly carried
out. What he contemplates would show perhaps fifty
selected characteristic seals for each century from the
eleventh to the seventeenth, displayed in order of date.
So large a number would not be needed at the earliest
or latest dates, but for some of the periods a greater
number ought to be given. Students now get together
such collections in tracings and drawings&mdash;as the labour
of years; and it is feared very few have perseverance
enough to carry out fully their aim, but without such exact
data conclusions must be guess-work. Mr. Grazebrook
has such a collection for his own use, and knows from
experience what a great advantage it is.</p>

<p>This proposed well-illustrated book would not only be
most valuable and instructive to the Antiquary, it would
also possess a far wider and general interest, because
these are the highest specimens of Art remaining to us
of the early times in which they were made. Seals at
all dates are the results of the greatest skill and care
to be procured, according to the owner's means; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
many of them are masterpieces, both of design and
execution. They display the whole career of Art: the
simplicity of early times, gradually developing and culminating
in the perfection of the fourteenth century;
to be followed by overloaded designs, beautified by
exquisite workmanship, at the end of the fifteenth.</p>

<p>Such a pictured History of Art could not fail to be
interesting and attractive to many who would not care
to study the subject from a strictly antiquarian point
of view.</p>

<p>This large collection of engravings would be accompanied
by explanations giving an account of most of
the seals, the origin of their decorations, and other
particulars involving a considerable amount of genealogical
research; which, even when epitomised, must form
a bulky volume; and it would require a large body of
Subscribers at 30<i>s.</i> to cover the expense; but the author
trusts he may be encouraged by such extended support
that he may be able somewhat to <em>increase</em> the number
of illustrations&mdash;many of which must be reproduced from
the copper plates in old and rare works, thus involving
considerable expense.</p>

<p>Subscriptions payable when the work is completed.</p>

<p>Gentlemen who would be willing to subscribe will please
write to that effect to <span class="smcap">George Grazebrook</span>, F.S.A.,
Oak Hill Park, near Liverpool.</p>

<p>Any suggestions for the improvement of the work
would be esteemed. The author will confine himself
strictly to</p>

Froissart, describing the battle of Poictiers, says that the Black Prince
commanded the body of the Lord Richard Duras to be laid on a shield, and
that five men should bear the same to the Cardinal of Peregorth for a
present, &amp;c. Also, that towards the end of the reign of Edward III, the
Frenchmen, to save themselves from the liberal shot of the English archers,
had shields made of elme-wood, seven feet in length and three in breadth
and an inch in thickness, which were made sharp at the foot to pitch into
the ground.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It would be curious to ascertain, if we could, how long the die sinkers
in early times required to make these large and splendid seals. I have only
noted a few instances which throw light upon it, but, no doubt, a careful
search might show the earliest dates after their succession when the several
kings used their new great seals. Rymer's <cite>Fœdera</cite> contains many orderings
and surrenderings of such seals; the great difficulty is to connect the
impression with the thing ordered or dealt with. Blackstone [<cite>The Great
Charter and the Charter of the Forest</cite>, 4to, 1759, pp. xxix and xliii] informs
us that the great Charter of Henry III, dated 12th November, 1216 (he was
crowned at Gloucester, 28th October, 1216), was sealed&mdash;as declared in the
document&mdash;with the seals of Gualo the Legate and William Earl of Pembroke;
King John's seal having been lost in passing the Washes of Lincolnshire, and
no new seal being made for King Henry till two years after. About
6th November, 1218, a new great seal was made for King Henry III, and
then began to be used in sealing writs, of course, but was forbidden to be
put to anything which might tend to perpetuity till the king should arrive to
full age; and a footnote is added, "It has not even in later times been
altogether unusual for the successor to defer for a while the making of a
new great seal,&mdash;and in the interim to use his predecessor's:&mdash;The Editor
has met with a patent of Rich<sup>d</sup> Cromwell, dated 18 Nov. 1658, [11 weeks
after his protectorship commenced] which was sealed with Oliver's seal."
Roger de Hoveden notes, under the year 1194, that Richard I. ordered a new
great seal to be made, but the earliest deed to which it is known to be
attached bears date 18th May, 1198&mdash;that is, four years afterwards. (M.
Deville's <cite>Treatise on the Seals of Richard I.</cite>, and <cite>Archæological Journal</cite>,
vol. iii, p. 372.) Among the Standish Deeds, which I had lately the honour
to lay before this Society, was one&mdash;a licence to found a chantry at Standish&mdash;granted
by Edward III. on 12th February, 1328, and with apparently an
unfinished seal. The impression is a bad one, but the lions afterwards on the
horse clothing seem to be wanting. He only ascended the throne 25th
January, 1327. On the fourth day of his reign, viz., 28th January, 1327, he
delivered his great seal to the Bishop of Ely as Chancellor, two fleur-de-lys
having been engraved on the under side thereof (Rymer's <cite>Fœdera</cite>, vol. ii,
p. 683). This was his father's seal, thus slightly altered on one side. In
October of the same year Edward III. stated by proclamation that he had a
new great seal, different on both sides from the seal hitherto used; which
great seal was to have authority from 4th October, 1327. Rymer, vol. ii,
p. 718, records that the previous seal was broken up in the king's presence,
in his chamber in the Castle of Nottingham. See Professor Willis on the
great seals of Edward III., a learned paper printed in the <cite>Archæological
Journal</cite>, vol. ii, p. 14.</p></div></div>
